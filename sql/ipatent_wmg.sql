The plugin offers an interesting new attempt at providing multi-language support for WordPress sites. WPGlobus allows you to configure a set of available languages and adds a dropdown language switcher to the frontend via a custom menu.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-language-switcher.png" rel="prettyphoto[27334]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-language-switcher.png?resize=1025%2C437" alt="wpglobulus-language-switcher" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39369" /></a></p>\n<p>The development team behind <a href="http://www.wpglobus.com/" target="_blank">WPGlobus</a> is led by WordPress developer Gregory Karpinsky. He designed the tool to be used on bilingual/multilingual WordPress sites. To be clear, the plugin does not provide translations, but rather allows you to create your own translations for pages and posts in the admin.</p>\n<p>Karpinsky quotes the venerable Capt. O.B.Vious in his reasoning behind creating the plugin: <strong>&#8220;People are a lot more likely to interact with your website if it is available in their own language.&#8221;</strong> WPGlobus was designed to make it easy for anyone to add a language switcher to their site without too much hassle.</p>\n<p>The current version of the plugin offers the following feature highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add multiple languages and countries to your site.</li>\n<li>Translate posts, pages, categories, tags and menus using a clean and simple interface.</li>\n<li>Switch languages at the front end using a dropdown menu with language names and country flags.</li>\n<li>Supports the WP-SEO titles and descriptions in multiple languages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first step in using the plugin is to select the languages you want to be available in the frontend dropdown. WPGlobus offers different ways to customize the way the languages appear in the menu and comes with flag images pre-installed for each language. The images are also customizable, should you wish to add your own or define custom combinations of country flags and language abbreviations.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-admin-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[27334]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-admin-settings.png?resize=1025%2C685" alt="wpglobulus-admin-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39366" /></a></p>\n<p>If you have a relatively small website that is quick to translate, you can paste translations for other languages directly into WPGlobus&#8217; tabbed interface in the post editor.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-editor.png" rel="prettyphoto[27334]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wpglobulus-editor.png?resize=1025%2C586" alt="wpglobulus-editor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39367" /></a></p>\n<p>The frontend dropdown menu allows visitors to switch between languages and displays them by changing the URL (/{language}/page/).</p>\n<p>In its current state, WPGlobus was designed for simple, static sites. For example, it could be useful for an event where attendees speak a handful of different languages. In this instance, the event staff can easily translate event details on the various pages to provide information for attendees in their own languages.</p>\n<p>For large sites and blogs, an expanded version of WPGlobus is in the works, which would integrate with multilingual plugins, such as WPML, qTranslate, or Polylang. Further down the road, Karpinsky hopes to integrate functionality that will assist e-commerce vendors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When it comes to e-Commerce, additional challenges may arise. The Buyer, the Seller and the Site Administrator may all speak different languages. A user may have a non-trivial combination of residence, language and currency. Some countries are multilingual, so clicking on a country flag is not always enough. WPGlobus attempts to solve those problems. It’s a long way down the road but we are full of energy and optimism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At the moment, the plugin is suitable for WordPress administrators who want to make their sites more global and are willing to provide their own translations. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpglobus/" target="_blank">WPGlobus</a> is available from WordPress.org. I tested the plugin, and, although it&#8217;s still technically in beta, it works as advertised for providing your own translations on a small website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 23:12:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"WPTavern: New Plugin Detects Shared Terms in WordPress Ahead of Taxonomy Term Splitting in 4.2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39295";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-detects-shared-terms-in-wordpress-ahead-of-taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4866:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/split.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[39295]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/split.jpg?resize=1024%2C498" alt="photo credit: Utičnice - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-39352" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11932978@N00/3560243700">Utičnice</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/16/taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2-a-developer-guide/" target="_blank">Taxonomy term splitting</a> in WordPress 4.2 addresses <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5809" target="_blank">a seven-year-old bug</a> that occasionally posed a nuisance to developers. In the past, WordPress allowed terms to be shared between multiple taxonomies. This caused a problem where updating a shared term would change the others unintentionally.</p>\n<p>Boone Gorges&#8217; progress on this ticket marks a major milestone on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/" target="_blank">taxonomy component roadmap</a> that Andrew Nacin outlined in 2013. Splitting shared terms paves the way for more exciting improvements to taxonomy meta and post relationships in the future.</p>\n<p>Gorges explained how taxonomy term splitting will work in 4.2:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress will detect whether the term is shared between multiple taxonomies, and if so, will create a new row in wp_terms for the updated term and change all necessary term_taxonomy associations. term_taxonomy_id will stay the same, but term_id will change. This is a case of a shared term being split into separate terms.</p>\n<p>In most cases, term splitting will go unnoticed. However, there are some plugins and themes that store term IDs as static data. In these cases, a changed term ID has the potential to cause various sorts of problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He identified 11 out of the top 100 plugins on WordPress.org that will be affected by this change in 4.2, due to the fact that they store term IDs independently in the database. Plugin authors are advised to update their extensions to facilitate split term ID migration, and Gorges offers an example in his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/16/taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2-a-developer-guide/" target="_blank">post on the Make/Core blog</a>.</p>\n<h3>Find out if your WordPress site is using any shared terms.</h3>\n<p>Shared terms are extremely uncommon. However, if you&#8217;re curious to find out if your site has any, the new <a href="https://github.com/jjeaton/wp-find-shared-terms" target="_blank">WP Find Shared Terms</a> plugin makes it easy to detect shared terms and will list them along with their associated taxonomies.</p>\n<p>After installing it, you can visit Tools > Find Shared Terms to see a list. I tested it and found that it works as advertised to detect shared terms, their IDs, taxonomies, and associated posts:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shared-terms.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[39295]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shared-terms.jpg?resize=934%2C402" alt="shared-terms" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39344" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin was created by <a href="http://www.josheaton.org/" target="_blank">Josh Eaton</a>, Partner at <a href="http://reaktivstudios.com/" target="_blank">Reaktiv Studios</a>. Eaton developed it to help users plan ahead for upcoming taxonomy changes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This may be helpful in determining whether you need to refactor any custom code that stores term IDs or upgrade any of your plugins prior to the 4.2 upgrade,&#8221; he <a href="http://www.josheaton.org/find-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress/" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;If your site doesn’t have any shared terms, and you’ve already upgraded to 4.1 then you’re in the clear!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Eaton said even if you detect that your site has shared terms, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you&#8217;ll have a problem updating. Detecting shared terms should prompt you to check that the plugins you&#8217;re using are properly updated for 4.2.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that shared terms in WordPress 4.2 will not be retroactively split, but will only be split if the terms are updated in the dashboard, i.e. renamed, etc. Gorges advises that there are plans to force all shared terms to be split in a future release. It&#8217;s prudent to plan ahead now. If you suspect that you might have an issue with shared terms, install the <a href="https://github.com/jjeaton/wp-find-shared-terms" target="_blank">WP Find Shared Terms</a> plugin as a first step and monitor your WordPress plugins for updates ahead of the 4.2 release.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 19:28:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: Do You Use The Sticky Posts Feature in WordPress?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39326";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1191:"<p><a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Sticky_Posts" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Sticky_Posts">Sticky posts, </a>introduced in <a title="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/">WordPress 2.7</a>, gives authors the ability to stick or feature posts to the front page.

It uses the <a href="http://wptavern.com/gravityforms-1-8-beta-released-introduces-api" target="_blank">Gravity Forms API</a> to display unique views of form data and entries on the frontend of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The main <a href="https://github.com/katzwebservices/GravityView" target="_blank">GravityView plugin</a> is now public on GitHub for anyone to access for free. The plugin&#8217;s repository was previously private and the code accessible only to GravityView&#8217;s paid customers, but co-founder Zack Katz recently decided to go another direction with the project.</p>\n<p>Katz told the Tavern that he was inspired by a <a href="https://mattreport.com/interview-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank">discussion between Matt Medeiros and Matt Mullenweg</a> on ubiquity vs. scarcity in WordPress product businesses. Medeiros asked Mullenweg if he could offer any advice to WordPress startups that are looking to create a new product in this crowded space. Mullenweg replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The one pattern I see most right now that I think is not sustainable is, and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the easiest thing to do, is businesses that are built on a scarcity &#8211; the thing not being widely available. If you think about some of the coolest successes so far in WordPress, the Gravity Forms, some of the theme businesses, they are inherently predicated on the fact that you have to pay to access them. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of businesses that grow with ubiquity, that become more powerful the more ubiquitous they are, more valuable. WordPress itself is one of these. Akismet is one of these. Jetpack is certainly one of those. </p>\n<p>So if you think about turning that on its head, I think that&#8217;s what will create the sort of multi-generational businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. Even with themes, we&#8217;ve seen that themes are very cyclical. People who used to make the majority of their money from themes, like WooThemes, are now finding it&#8217;s an ever-decreasing percentage. You hear this across almost all the theme shops.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This advice runs counter to the way many WordPress product businesses have structured their revenue models. Rare exceptions like <a href="http://wptavern.com/pippin-williamson-on-building-a-community-around-your-open-source-project" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wooconf-the-first-ever-conference-dedicated-to-woocommerce-deemed-a-success" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a>, and other plugins where the base software is free, are shining examples where pushing for ubiquity instead of scarcity has truly paid off.</p>\n<p>The founders behind <a href="https://gravityview.co/" target="_blank">GravityView</a> are looking to find the same success within the Gravity Forms micro-ecosystem. With the base <a href="https://github.com/katzwebservices/GravityView" target="_blank">GravityView plugin</a> now available for free on GitHub, the company&#8217;s pricing is now only applicable to support and extensions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 21:47:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: USB History and Type C";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44672";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2015/02/usb-history-and-type-c/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:611:"<p>I enjoyed this Ars Technica look at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/usb-3-1-and-type-c-the-only-stuff-at-ces-that-everyone-is-going-to-use/">USB 3.1 and Type-C</a>, which is probably the cable/connection change people will notice the most over the next few years.

Also, the experience for creating new pages is very nice. While I have many disagreements with certain choices they made from a design perspective, overall I am very impressed with what they have done for the page building user experience.</p>\n<h3>Layers user experience sets a high bar</h3>\n<p>Layers has some very &#8220;wow&#8221; worthy features.</p>\n<p>I am very impressed with Obox&#8217;s onboarding. Upon theme activation, it takes you straight to a progressive walk-through that helps you learn about and setup Layers. It includes videos that operate like playable GIFs that show you what it&#8217;s referencing in each stage.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8810" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-onboarding-752x364.png" alt="layers-onboarding" width="752" height="364" /></p>\n<p>The editor itself is also impressive. Layers are managed totally through the customizer. There is a single customizer tab that opens up panels for Layer widgets, which is very in tune with default WordPress.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8809" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-edit-widget-752x351.png" alt="layers-edit-widget" width="752" height="351" /></p>\n<p>I call this method &#8220;going all in on the customizer&#8221;, which some people love and some people hate. I haven&#8217;t yet made up my mind, but I definitely like this better than many other methods I&#8217;ve seen &#8212; such as completely going outside of the WordPress UI.</p>\n<p>Within the WordPress page itself, it calls you to go to the Layers customizer to edit the content, but also has options for duplicating, importing, or exporting Layers templates.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8813" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-page-752x475.png" alt="layers-page" width="752" height="475" /></p>\n<p>I like the way Layers makes getting started pretty easy. And I&#8217;m sure they will offer more templates going forward to help users quickly build pages that would otherwise require custom code.</p>\n<p>Obox is really stretching their legs on UX, and they are unabashedly prioritizing UX over everything else.</p>\n<p>David Perel &#8212; co-founder of Obox &#8212; tells me, &#8220;We believe in UX more than anything. Code is solveable; it just takes time. But user experience isn&#8217;t black and white.&#8221; I encouraged him to get more involved with core WordPress&#8217; various UX projects, as I completely agree with his sentiment.</p>\n<h3>Behind the curtains of Layers code</h3>\n<p>When I first looked under the hood of Layers, I was completely baffled by some of the code decisions. Saving a page in Layers does not save anything to the actual <code>post_content</code> in WordPress, nor even in meta. No, content is essentially grouped &#8212; across any page ID &#8212; and stored in the options table, depending on the type of module in use.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8811" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-options.png" alt="layers-options" width="657" height="199" /></p>\n<p>So, if you view the options field of <code>widget_layers-widget-column</code>, you see this:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8812" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-option-752x369.png" alt="layers-option" width="752" height="369" /></p>\n<p>The above image is content for any column module in the Layers theme. Meanwhile, the <code>post_content</code> for the page you create is completely empty.</p>\n<p>I was baffled by this architecture decision, as it means that I can never recover that content or use it again unless I&#8217;m using Layers. While the UX may fit well into the WordPress experience, the code seemed far, far from it; and it was a complete blocker for me. Then I talked to David Perel.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness he showed me their backup tool. Before that, this post looked <em>much, much</em> different.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8820" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/layers-backup-752x386.png" alt="layers-backup" width="752" height="386" /></p>\n<p>They are working to automatically port content to the proper field in the database, but for now you can manually do it, so that your markup at least is preserved for if you change themes. This methodology is in line with other responsible page building tools like The Theme Foundry&#8217;s <a title="Make and Make Plus, a drag and drop framework from The Theme Foundry" href="https://poststatus.com/make-drag-and-drop-theme-foundry/">Make theme</a>.</p>\n<p>I also talked to David about disappointing front-end performance. The theme loads 16 styles and scripts on every page, no matter what. Scripts like Masonry are loading &#8212; and more than one Masonry related script &#8212; whether the page uses Masonry or not. Those are just the scripts that are not conditional at all. On page inspection of some of their common templates, I was seeing well over 20 HTTP requests for styles and scripts. This simply should not be acceptable. This, at least, is fixable.</p>\n<p>After discussing this with David, they are already working to implement a fix that will combine many of these files, and conditionally load others. Layers is 1.0, so while I wish this wasn&#8217;t an afterthought, I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re moving fast to improve.</p>\n<p>Overall, Obox is trying really hard on Layers; and they&#8217;ve shipped an impressive 1.0. They are doing active reviews still with some highly qualified WordPress developers whose names we all would know, and we can expect further improvements on performance down the line.</p>\n<h3>Where to get Layers, and notes on the monetization model</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.layerswp.com/">Layers</a> is free, and on <a href="https://github.com/Obox/layerswp">Github</a>. They also have <a href="http://www.layerswp.com/developers/">developer</a> notes and general <a href="http://docs.layerswp.com/">docs</a> available. The Obox team is also working to get the product on WordPress.org, but there are some things they have to work out before they can.</p>\n<p>For monetization, they intend to charge for pre-built child themes and commercial extensions. For now, they want to get mass adoption for Layers &#8212; a tactic that has worked really well for others in the space.</p>\n<h3>Thoughts on page builders</h3>\n<p>I am definitely not on the bandwagon for page builders, though it seems the WordPress product world is. Where traditional options heavy theme sales have died away, page builders have risen from their ashes.</p>\n<p>I think anyone building a tool like this needs someone at their side forcing them to justify every feature &#8212; as it seems to me that most of these are giving way too many options in their products.</p>\n<p>I may have a follow-up post in my mind that I&#8217;ll probably publish sometime soon describing why I think it is a bad thing for page builders (in the context of theming) to be the future of the web.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid, however, that end user &#8220;demand&#8221; may make it so whether I like it or not; but it won&#8217;t be for their own good. I think there is a better way. I think &#8220;page building&#8221;, as it seems we&#8217;ve standardized the term, is broken when too many granular design elements are allowed. Instead, I&#8217;d like to see <em>content building</em>, where structured content can be created with a tool, but theming and styles are still left to, well, themes.</p>\n<p>Tools like <a href="http://aesopstoryengine.com/">Aesop</a> story engine, <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/">Make</a>, and <a href="http://www.layerswp.com/">Layers</a> are all making what I consider valiant efforts at evolving complex content creation for WordPress. I don&#8217;t think anyone is quite nailing it, but I like where at least these three projects are going for the most part. I&#8217;m happy to see Obox release their vision of what content creation should be in WordPress, with Layers.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 20:46:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: BuddyPress Breaks One-Day Download Record with 2.2.1 Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39240";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-breaks-one-day-download-record-with-2-2-1-release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3420:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png" rel="prettyphoto[39240]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?resize=839%2C398" alt="buddypress-logo-blue" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30655" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href="https://buddypress.org/2015/02/2015-buddypress-survey/" target="_blank">2015 BuddyPress Survey</a> is out on the heels of the <a href="https://buddypress.org/2015/02/buddypress-2-2-1/" target="_blank">2.2.1 maintenance release</a>.

Last year&#8217;s survey demonstrated that the community is growing and users are eager to stay on top of updates. The <a href="https://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/" target="_blank">2014 survey results</a> indicated that more than 50% of BuddyPress sites are on the latest versions of WordPress and BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>When asked to choose categories for feature improvements, respondents selected group enhancements, a new media component, activity stream, membership add-ons, performance, and a few others. Many of these requests were addressed during 2014 development on the plugin. <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-to-add-custom-post-type-support-to-the-activity-stream" target="_blank">Custom post types were added to the activity stream</a>, performance was enhanced beyond user expectations, and a new<a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-on-track-to-provide-a-basic-member-type-api" target="_blank"> member type API</a> was introduced earlier this year.

Lead developers and contributors in attendance agreed that there are no major blocking issues.</p>\n<p>The Customizer Theme Switcher in WordPress 4.2 will make it possible for users to browse through themes that have already been installed and activate a new one on the frontend via the customizer. The idea is to unify the UI designated for customizing a site to create a more consistent experience for users on the frontend. In the future, the theme installation process will also be added to the customizer.</p>\n<p>Many users initially had concerns about adding this feature to the narrow customizer UI. &#8220;I would like to see a full-screen iteration so it doesn&#8217;t feel like I am looking through a port hole,&#8221; Andrew Nacin said during the development meeting. His comment echoes the concerns of others who have doubts about browsing themes through the small customizer window.</p>\n<p>In response to WP Tavern <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-theme-switcher-officially-proposed-for-wordpress-4-2#comment-64073" target="_blank">commenters who oppose the new feature</a>, project leader Nick Halsey encouraged users to examine how the customizer will force developers to simplify their UIs:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll also point out for everyone that while the Customizer controls window is fairly small, this is a balance with providing a reasonably sized preview of the front-end, and the narrow controls UI window is mobile-first out-of-the-box. Being forced to work with less real estate in the customizer controls forces developers to simplify their UIs and make things easier to use. If you’re shoving hundreds of options into the Customizer, you’re creating something that’s just as bad of an experience to use as if you’d done that in a custom admin screen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In response to those concerned about the next step of adding the theme installation process to the customizer, Halsey <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-theme-switcher-officially-proposed-for-wordpress-4-2#comment-64035" target="_blank">assured</a> users that they are planning on making the customizer controls area almost full-width. This will ensure a more pleasant experience while selecting a theme from a large collection. The theme switcher feature added to WordPress 4.2 will happen in the more narrow customizer pane, since it is most often limited to a small collection of already installed themes.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/" target="_blank">Press This Revamp project</a> is also currently under consideration for merge into WordPress 4.2 and contributors will be testing it over the next week. The merge window runs through next Wednesday, followed by two weeks of iteration before the first beta is expected.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 22:09:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: CMS Commander’s WordPress Site Creation Tool is Available for Free";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39187";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/cms-commanders-wordpress-site-creation-tool-is-available-for-free";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2784:"<p>CMS Commander <a title="http://cmscommander.com/create-pre-configured-wp-blogs-free/" href="http://cmscommander.com/create-pre-configured-wp-blogs-free/">has announced</a> that their new WordPress site creation tool will be <a title="https://cmscommander.com/members/signup/index/c/trial" href="https://cmscommander.com/members/signup/index/c/trial">free of charge</a>.

Over the years, the uses for multisite have evolved to encompass those who use it to facilitate the management of multiple, and sometimes unrelated, sites. In the future, contributors want to add the option for super admins to select from a list of pre-configured network types when installing a new network.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-multisite/p1424209234000834" target="_blank">discussion</a> in the #core-multisite room on Slack this week centered around identifying and defining different network types.  The terms Open/Closed and Trusted/Untrusted were identified as possibilities, but nothing has been set in stone, as both options are ambiguous and confusing.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Felt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/multisite-objective-defining-network-types/" target="_blank">summarized</a> the questions that need to be answered before multisite development can move forward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What network types are there?</li>\n<li>Which of these should be pre-configured in core?</li>\n<li>What are possible ways of managing these network types?</li>\n<li>What kind of experience can we introduce during network installation that makes this simple.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Multisite is used in a wide variety of ways, i.e. networks where super admins control everything, blogging networks where site admins have limited capabilities, private networks with closed registration and a set of trusted admins, and many more. It&#8217;s difficult to accurately nail down a small set of pre-configured network types that will be suitable for any new installation.</p>\n<p>One interesting idea, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/multisite-objective-defining-network-types/#comment-25248" target="_blank">proposed by Mike Schinkel</a>, is to allow developers to register a custom network type in order to better fit unique cases:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It would seem the first step, then, would be to identify and document all these potential configuration options at an atomic level. From there we could then “map” Network Types to their associated configuration settings.</p>\n<p>Even better, Network Types could then be registered just like how Post Types, Post Statuses, and Taxonomies are registered which would make missing out on an important use-case in core much less problematic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even with the option to register custom network types, WordPress core will still need to identify the most common ones to include in its set of pre-configured options. Contributors have been discussing this issue over the span of several months in order to find the best way forward.</p>\n<p>If you want to join in the conversation regarding the future of multisite, particularly as it relates to defining network types, make sure to leave your feedback on the recent Make/Core post: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/multisite/" target="_blank">Multisite Objective: Defining Network Types</a>.

Some common use cases include: floor plans for trade shows, real estate properties, and seating charts. Nathan Tyler explains the inspiration behind the plugin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Natalie and I have built custom solutions for clients for trade shows, real estate, floor plans, etc. and we&#8217;re always frustrated by the process. We wanted to build an elegant solution in WordPress that would display well on all devices and would be easy for clients and end-users to maintain themselves.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>After installation, a new item labeled Draw Attention is added to the admin menu. Similar to a post, the edit image screen has an area to give images a title. There&#8217;s also a series of options to configure the highlight and info box styling. Users can add an image via upload or through the WordPress media library.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionEditImageScreen.png" rel="prettyphoto[39165]"><img class="size-full wp-image-39177" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionEditImageScreen.png?resize=1025%2C405" alt="Edit Image Screen" /></a>Edit image screen for Draw Attention\n<p>Once an image is added, you&#8217;ll see it near the bottom of the page within the Hotspot Areas section. From here, users can draw interactive hot spots on an image simply by clicking on the portion you want to highlight. It took a bit of practice, but I was able to make the entire logo a hotspot by clicking the edges of the circle. Hot spots can be manipulated by clicking and dragging on the square markers.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpots.png" rel="prettyphoto[39165]"><img class="size-full wp-image-39178" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpots.png?resize=1025%2C701" alt="Draw Attention Hot Spots" /></a>Draw Attention hot spots\n<p>One of the biggest drawbacks I discovered during testing, is that there&#8217;s no undo button. If you make a mistake, you need to select the clear button and start over. Depending on the size of the hot spot, it&#8217;s a frustrating user experience. Hot spots are able to have titles of their own as well as a description. You can also add a detailed image which will display above the more info box. Last but not least, you can remove the hot spot area from the image.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpotsConfig.png" rel="prettyphoto[39165]"><img class="size-full wp-image-39179" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpotsConfig.png?resize=1002%2C493" alt="DrawAttentionHotSpotConfiguration" /></a>Draw Attention hot spot configuration\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what an interactive image looks like on the WordPress frontend. What you can&#8217;t see from the screenshot, is that clicking on a hot spot displays the image title and description above the image using <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">Ajax</a>. In order to display interactive images, the <strong>[drawattention]</strong> short code needs to be inserted into a post or page. The styling options as seen in the first screenshot control how the title and description display on the frontend. It&#8217;s also worth noting that interactive images are responsive, so they&#8217;ll look good on mobile devices.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpotsWordPressFrontend.png" rel="prettyphoto[39165]"><img class="size-full wp-image-39180" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DrawAttentionHotSpotsWordPressFrontend.png?resize=1025%2C810" alt="Draw Attention Hot Spots WordPress Frontend" /></a>How hot spots look on the WordPress frontend\n<h2>Needs Improvements</h2>\n<p>Draw Attention is a neat plugin that makes it easy to create hot spots on images. However, it&#8217;s the first version and it shows. In future versions, I&#8217;d like to see a number of things addressed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I&#8217;m confused as to the order of options displayed in the backend as styling options are displayed above image editing. I think these option panels should be reversed.</li>\n<li>The default highlight and info box styles didn&#8217;t display well on the testing environment. I&#8217;d like to see these options inherit colors that already exist within the theme.</li>\n<li>As mentioned previously, there needs to be an undo button as starting over is a frustrating experience.</li>\n<li>Setting the opacity to 55% displays a value of 55.00000000000001%</li>\n<li>Speaking of styling colors, it&#8217;s frustrating to edit display settings, click update, then refresh the post or page to see if the changes are ok. I&#8217;d like to see some sort of visual preview or something like the customizer so that I can configure the colors and see the changes live before I apply them.</li>\n<li>Instead of displaying the short code I need to use in a small, somewhat hidden meta box, I&#8217;d like to see a button in the visual post editor to make it easier to add to a post or page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the last remaining issues I have with Draw Attention is that users are limited to adding and editing <strong>one image</strong>. That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a <a title="http://tylerdigital.com/products/draw-attention/" href="http://tylerdigital.com/products/draw-attention/">pro version</a> of the plugin available for $49 that contains the following additional features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create more than one interactive image</li>\n<li>Unlimited number of hot spot areas for each image</li>\n<li>20 different preset color schemes</li>\n<li>Custom layout options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Limiting the plugin to one image gives users an idea on how it works, but I&#8217;d bump the limit to three or five. Users would then have more of an opportunity to discover cool uses cases and it might lead to more sales.</p>\n<p>With that said, it performed without any issues on WordPress 4.2 alpha. Tyler says they have plenty of items on their to-do list, &#8220;We have a bunch of items still on our to-do list, and we will be releasing regular updates for the next couple months based on community feedback.&#8221; If some of the issues are addressed and the image limits are raised, I think Draw Attention will be a nice solution for creating interactive images in WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 05:48:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: WordCamp Prague 2015 Aims to Bring Central European Tech Community Together";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39157";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-prague-2015-aims-to-bring-central-european-tech-community-together";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2983:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prague.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[39157]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/prague.jpg?resize=1025%2C498" alt="prague" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39158" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://prague.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Prague</a> is gearing up for its second edition on February 28, 2015.

Organizers are planning two tracks of presentations: one for end users and bloggers and the other for WordPress developers and programmers.</p>\n<p>Co-organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/vladamusilek" target="_blank">Vladislav Musílek</a> said that the team is expecting 300-350 attendees. &#8220;The Czech WordPress community is young and we started meeting in the summer of 2013,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were three small meetups with a maximum of 30 attendees, but our first WordCamp Prague in 2014 had 230 attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Musílek is one of three local organizers who decided to hold a larger meetup every three months, with smaller ones taking place monthly. The three meetups held in 2014 attracted 130-150 attendees each, and sessions are published on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUj8Epquc13YwVvnAzyI9Vg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>\n<p>Although the Czech WordPress community is relatively small, it is situated in central Europe with easy access for attendees from other countries. &#8220;We invited developers from other countries, because modern WordPress trends are what is missing in the Czech community,&#8221; Musílek said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But what is unique is Prague, a beautiful city in the center, with 23 European capital cities not more than 1000 km away, i.e. Vienna, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Paris, Rome, Warsaw and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Musílek said the organizers&#8217; goal was to create a WordCamp not only for the Czech community but for the greater central European development community. Many of the sessions cater to developers, and Musílek said this is intentional. &#8220;I am a developer and I wanted to invite speakers who are working with modern and trending technologies that we&#8217;ll be using for development in the near future,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Prague&#8217;s schedule will host 16 sessions, including nine in English and seven in Czech. There will also be two workshops held in English and two in Czech. The variety of languages helps to make the event more accessible to international attendees.

Last week, core contributor Gary Pendergast, unveiled <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/13/emoji-chat-meeting-notes-february-12-2015/" target="_blank">a roadmap for better emoji support</a> and detailed the current state of the <a href="https://github.com/pento/x1f4a9" target="_blank">feature plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Pendergast has spent quite a bit of time immersing himself in the history of emoji and the requirements for their support. Pendergast filled contributors in on the status of WordPress core support for emoji:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31349" target="_blank">r31349</a>, WordPress partially supports emoji. ~60% of WordPress sites are running MySQL 5.5 or later (so can be upgraded to store emoji), and ~40% of browsers natively support emoji. Emoji are a wildly popular method of communication, so we can expect them to be heavily used as soon as they’re available. The problem is, 60%/40% means a really bad experience for a huge number of our users, who’ll try to use emoji, and fail.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting more WordPress sites to run on  MySQL 5.5+ would be no small task, so the emoji feature plugin is working around this by adding a wp_encode_emoji() function to turn emoji characters into HTML entities for sites using the utf8 character set. This gets the remaining ~40% of sites nearly all the way there.</p>\n<h3>Twemoji Fallback</h3>\n<p>The feature plugin proposes that WordPress adopt the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji" target="_blank">Twemoji</a> image set as a fallback for browsers that don&#8217;t display emoji natively, which reduces the extra load, especially for mobile browsers. Twitter open sourced its Twemoji 872 character image set last November, simultaneously partnering with Automattic to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-emoji-support-coming-soon-to-jetpack" target="_blank">bring emoji to WordPress.com users</a>.</p>\n<p>Pendergast reports that the plugin is close to being finished, with only a handful of remaining <a href="https://github.com/pento/x1f4a9/issues" target="_blank">bugs to discuss</a>. The plugin has already been briefly reviewed by the accessibility team and requires only a few minor changes. The issue of where to host the images is still under discussion, and Pendergast and contributors are considering different options:</p>\n<blockquote><p>They’re currently hosted on WP.com’s CDN, but we’re investigating other options for where to host them, probably the W.org CDN. Given that the wp-admin Dashboard also loads things from Google, I have no problem with hosting them on an external CDN. There will naturally be a filter on the URL, to allow local hosting for sites that don’t want to use the CDN.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress is on track to provide more comprehensive support for emoji in the near future. Pendergast says the project is on target for the upcoming 4.2 release.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;d like to add emoji support to your self-hosted WordPress site, <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-open-source-emoji-one-support-to-wordpress" target="_blank">WP Emoji One</a> is a good option.

Peshev explains why titles are out of control and how they don&#8217;t match their expected skill sets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The problem with a number of general titles is that they are overused and it is no longer clear what the real meaning and level of expertise is. Moreover, they are so general, that it’s easy to be fooled into misusing them, seeing how many people just tag themselves in those categories.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I find it fascinating we&#8217;re having conversations on what people in the WordPress ecosystem call themselves. This is a big problem for people looking for WordPress experts who are routinely let down, because the people they&#8217;re hiring don&#8217;t actually have the skills required to get the job done.</p>\n<p>In some ways, the conversation circles back to the idea of having a <a title="http://wptavern.com/should-automattic-create-and-manage-a-wordpress-certification-program" href="http://wptavern.com/should-automattic-create-and-manage-a-wordpress-certification-program">WordPress certification program</a>. With a certification program, a document would clarify a person&#8217;s proficiency in WordPress. However, I think it opens up a new can of worms and isn&#8217;t the only solution.</p>\n<h2>Comparing a Corporate World to WordPress</h2>\n<p>In a typical corporation, titles are clearly laid out and each one has a set of skills attached to it. Employees know what they need to learn to get promoted to the next level. Employees also know the skills a person has with a particular title due to standards that dictate how it&#8217;s earned. In the WordPress ecosystem, titles are not earned, but rather, routinely made up. For example, I&#8217;ve used WordPress for more than seven years and consider myself a WordPress Tinkerer.</p>\n<p>Peshev outlines three distinct problems with the lack of standards, best practices, and business know-how in the WordPress community.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serious clients can&#8217;t find experts since everyone is an expert.</li>\n<li>Experts don&#8217;t get approached for larger systems (due to (1) ) and their time is wasted by people with the wrong perception of <em>expert</em>.</li>\n<li>The lack of satisfied clients and contractors means fewer customers are willing to invest in WordPress, fewer contractors are able to dedicate time back to WordPress, and there are fewer products developed as a result of WordPress driven projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When looking at the big picture, the situation is a mess. It seems everyone has a WordPress title with no clear way to determine the skills that back it. Outside of some sort of regulation, I don&#8217;t see how the situation can improve. Perhaps the community can rally together to create a list of titles and assign appropriate skills to them? If you use a title to express your skills and knowledge to potential clients, what is it?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 23:24:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Keep a CHANGELOG Project Aims to Standardize Best Practices for Writing Change Logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39051";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"http://wptavern.com/keep-a-changelog-project-aims-to-standardize-best-practices-for-writing-change-logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3140:"<p>A change log is the quickest, most convenient way for users and contributors to identify significant changes in a project as it moves from one version to the next.

Jobs replied, “Why would you be vague?,” arguing that ambiguity was a form of selfishness: “You don’t care about how they feel! You’re being vain, you want them to like you.” Ive was furious, but came to agree. “It’s really demeaning to think that, in this deep desire to be liked, you’ve compromised giving clear, unambiguous feedback,” he said. He lamented that there were “so many anecdotes” about Jobs’s acerbity: “His intention, and motivation, wasn’t to be hurtful.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Your one #longread today should be <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come">the New Yorker&#8217;s profile of Jonathan Ive</a> by Ian Parker. This anecdote resonated with me from the time I (poorly) did design for a living, and how much patience and stoicism are part of the job when working with a deciding stakeholder, often known as a client:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bob Mansfield, a former senior hardware engineer at Apple, who is now semi-retired, recently described the pique that some colleagues felt about Ive’s privileged access. As he put it, “There’s always going to be someone vying for Dad’s attention.” But Mansfield was grateful for Ive’s cool handling of a C.E.O. who was “not the easiest guy to please.” Mansfield’s view was “Jony puts up with a lot, and, as a result of him doing it, people like me don’t have to.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>This also made me giggle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brunner is proud of the Beats brand, but it took him time to adjust to a design rhythm set as if for a sneaker company: “Originally, I hated it—‘Let’s do a version in the L.A. Lakers’ colors!’ ” He laughed. “ ‘Great. Purple and yellow. <em>Fantastic</em>.’ ”</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come">Check out the entire thing</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:01:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: Pollan on Psychedelics";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44682";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://ma.tt/2015/02/pollan-on-psychedelics/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:643:"<p>To make it a full New Yorker weekend, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://longreads.com/">longread</a> from <a href="http://michaelpollan.com/">Michael Pollan</a>, best known for his book <a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/the-omnivores-dilemma/">Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</a>, on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment">the reopened research on the potential therapeutic uses of psychedelics</a>.

Content in the post editor is styled to match the front end, so users don&#8217;t need to leave the editor in order to see how it&#8217;s going to look.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mayer-for-wordpress-1024x819.png" rel="prettyphoto[38975]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mayer-for-wordpress-1024x819.png?resize=1024%2C819" alt="mayer-for-wordpress-1024x819" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39004" /></a></p>\n<p>Technically, the theme is already open source in terms of its licensing. However, up until this point, it was only distributed commercially via WordPress.com. McFarlin has written <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/open-source-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/mayer-for-wordpress-now-on-github/" target="_blank">posts</a> about how he came to the decision to make his products freely available on GitHub. He cites collaboration and accountability as the driving factors in his decision:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The advantage to this means that all of the work that the team and I have backlogged for this project (and for future projects) is publicly visible if for no other reason than for accountability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ideally though, we’d be able to benefit from the open source community that comes in the form of code reviews, pull requests, or just general conversations to help make the core product better.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Free Products ≠ Free Support</h3>\n<p>Any theme or plugin author who decides to distribute a product for free will inevitably find the burden of support knocking at the door. It&#8217;s important to specify how much support, if any, is included for users who are receiving a product for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the code itself falls under an open source license, then I’m willing to make the code freely available,&#8221; McFarlin said. <strong>&#8220;This does not mean that I’m willing to support the code base for those who haven’t paid, but that leads into an entirely different discussion.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>McFarlin will continue to sell the Mayer theme through his <a href="http://shop.pressware.co/mayer/" target="_blank">Pressware shop</a>. The $99/year price tag offers users professional support for a year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, I’m not attempting yet-another-way to monetize or popularize a theme in hopes of making money,&#8221; McFarlin said. &#8220;The short of it is that the theme will sell given the right marketplace. If someone wants to freely use the theme, that’s fine – why not? After all, it may result in some pull requests or other issues that will improve the core theme.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Based on his experience navigating user expectations from open source software, McFarlin believes that there is no escaping the issue of support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">I think that if you’re in the business of WordPress products (versus services), you’re in the support business whether you intend to be or not.</span> Everything that you release – regardless of where the transaction actually happens – is going to yield support from some of the customers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order to gain access to said support, the transaction just moves back one step from after accessing the source code rather than before accessing the source code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This model is almost entirely the opposite of the larger theme marketplaces, such as Themeforest, where the customer has no option to preview the code or have a developer preview the code before purchasing the product. It&#8217;s essentially a blind purchase in hopes that you won&#8217;t have to ask for too much support.</p>\n<p>McFarlin is banking on the fact that users who need professional support will be willing to pay for it. <a href="http://themehybrid.com/" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a> is one notable shop that has pioneered this model for years, offering all of its open source products for free and charging for paid support. WordPress.com does something similar, with many of its free themes mirrored on WordPress.org. Pressware is moving in a similar direction and will be creating a products division to further experiment with the model. McFarlin plans to put more work up on GitHub in the future and will continue to write about his experience.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of WordPress theme developers have not experimented with this distribution model. For the most part, theme shops sell their products and free versions, if offered, are only available with a limited set of features. McFarlin hopes to prove that in an open source marketplace, a business can successfully sell support for a product that it&#8217;s already giving away for free.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 23:56:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Excellent Primer on the WordPress REST API Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=39010";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/excellent-primer-on-the-wordpress-rest-api-project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1981:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WordPressRestAPIPrimerFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[39010]"><img class="size-full wp-image-39017" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WordPressRestAPIPrimerFeaturedImage.png?resize=655%2C327" alt="Rest API Primer Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22280677@N07/3349296482">The Poor Man&#8217;s Racehorse?</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>In the past two years, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion surrounding the <a title="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API" href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WordPress REST API project</a>.

It&#8217;s more like introducing the new year&#8217;s model and stopping production on the previous one.

Big updates (like converting a theme to be responsive, or using new development techniques like icon fonts) is sometimes really difficult to do in a way that won’t break child themes.</p>\n<p>We’re using a mix of the &#8216;Fork It&#8217; and &#8216;Retire It&#8217; options at DevPress. The &#8216;Cascade&#8217; theme will become &#8216;Cascadia&#8217; (for example) and we’ll make the new theme available for free to all customers who purchased the free version. Less popular themes will just be retired as we add new themes to take their place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although theme shops are able to retire themes and set up redirects to newer versions, retiring a theme is not as easy to do on the WordPress theme directory. According to Price, &#8220;You can request a takedown and release a theme under a different name, but there&#8217;s no way to 301 redirect the established traffic to the new spot.&#8221; Not only does a theme author lose traffic, but they also can’t push out critical updates for retired themes.</p>\n<p>DevPress isn&#8217;t the first theme shop to use a retirement strategy. Since 2012, WooThemes has <a title="http://docs.woothemes.com/document/retired-themes/" href="http://docs.woothemes.com/document/retired-themes/">retired 92</a> themes. Array also <a title="https://array.is/theme-retirement/" href="https://array.is/theme-retirement/">retires themes</a>, but offers them for free with no support. A theme retirement strategy makes sense from a business perspective, but as a customer, I expect themes I buy to stick around for a year or more.</p>\n<p>As a customer, what do you think about commercial theme companies retiring themes? For commercial theme shops, how does such a strategy help your business?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 20:13:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Passing of David Carr";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44692";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/02/passing-of-david-carr/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:330:"<p>Shocked and dismayed this morning on the news that David Carr passed last night after collapsing in the New York Times newsroom, where he was working into the evening.

The media library used for uploading visual content and co-editing to give multiple users the ability to edit a post at the same time.</p>\n<p>Immediately following the deal, the team was tasked with revamping the post editor and replacing the media library on WordPress.com with Cloudup.

According to an announcement on the <a title="http://www.scrollkit.com/" href="http://www.scrollkit.com/">Scroll Kit website</a>, Ray and Brown joined the WordPress.com product team. Scroll Kit shut down its service and users had three months to export their content. I&#8217;ve never used Scroll Kit, so it&#8217;s hard to determine what improvements are influenced by Ray and Brown. <a title="http://wptavern.com/automattic-snaps-up-scroll-kit-to-add-to-the-wordpress-com-product-team" href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-snaps-up-scroll-kit-to-add-to-the-wordpress-com-product-team">We questioned</a> whether Scroll Kit&#8217;s editor would be added to the theme editing experience on WordPress.com.

Founded by Simon Dickson and Simon Wheatley, Code For The People was <a title="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-code-for-the-people-expands-wordpress-com-vips-reach-into-european-markets" href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-code-for-the-people-expands-wordpress-com-vips-reach-into-european-markets">acquired in 2014. </a>All six employees joined Automattic and will help out the VIP team during European hours.</p>\n<p>This acquisition is historic for two reasons. The first is that CTFP is the first WordPress development agency to be acquired by Automattic. Second, CFTP employee John Blackbourn was leading<a title="http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead" href="http://wptavern.com/meet-john-blackbourn-wordpress-4-1-release-lead"> the development cycle for WordPress 4.1</a> when the acquisition occurred, turning him into an Automattic employee.</p>\n<p>In addition to talent, they also obtained CFTP’s <a href="http://babbleplugin.com/" target="_blank">Babble</a> plugin, an open source multilingual tool, that will continue to be maintained by Automattic. According to <a title="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/automattic-buys-uks-code-for-the-people-to-build-out-its-wordpress-vip-enterprise-business/" href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/automattic-buys-uks-code-for-the-people-to-build-out-its-wordpress-vip-enterprise-business/">TechCrunch</a>, Mullenweg says Babble was a key part of the deal.</p>\n<h2>Thoughts and Observations</h2>\n<p>While going through the list of acquisitions Automattic has made over the years, a few things occurred to me. For all the great talent Automattic has acquired, it&#8217;s difficult to determine an individual&#8217;s influence on WordPress.com products. For instance, as an individual, Tom Witkin created an awesome mobile app for WordPress. Since being acquired, I can&#8217;t tell which improvements in the <a title="https://apps.wordpress.org/" href="https://apps.wordpress.org/">WordPress for iOS app</a> are the result of his work.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s due to time, difficulty, or other factors, certain items in some of the acquisition announcements have failed to materialize. A good example is the Cloudup acquisition. Nearly two years after the deal happened, WordPress.com and the self-hosted version still lack the ability to co-edit a post at the same time. There&#8217;s also no improvements to the media library I can trace back to the Cloudup team. It&#8217;s unclear if these are items still on the priority list or if they&#8217;ve been discarded.</p>\n<p>Another thing I noticed is that I didn&#8217;t recognize most of the businesses, products, and services acquired until after the acquisition announcement was published. It indicates Mullenweg has his eye on up and coming properties doing awesome things in the space. Unfortunately, in some instances, it means the product or service is shut down by Automattic eliminating any opportunity to use it. Poster, Blo.gs, and Scroll Kit immediately come to mind as things I&#8217;ll never  have the chance to use.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this trip down memory lane. We&#8217;re at the beginning of a new year and with <a title="http://recode.net/2014/05/05/wordpress-parent-automattic-has-raised-160-million-now-valued-at-1-16-billion-post-money/" href="http://recode.net/2014/05/05/wordpress-parent-automattic-has-raised-160-million-now-valued-at-1-16-billion-post-money/">Automattic raising $160M in 2014</a>, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before we read about the next acquisition.

Halsey summarizes the goal of bringing theme switching into the customizer: &#8220;By integrating themes directly into the Customizer, live-previewing workflows are greatly simplified, and the relationship between themes and theme/site options is clarified for the user,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Halsey explained that the new UI is part of a long-term plan to move all the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; functionality into the customizer. &#8220;The future roadmap includes <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-customizer">Menus</a>, Theme-Install, and iterations on widgets that would allow the customizer to entirely replace those admin screens for most users,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>His proposal includes a video that demonstrates how a user might scroll through the customizer to browse and preview available themes.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that if this feature plugin is cleared for merge, users will not have to search for and install themes from the narrow customizer pane. The Customizer Theme Switcher is intended for previewing and activating themes that have already been installed. Contributors on the project are proposing that WordPress 4.2 redirect the &#8220;Themes&#8221; link that appears in the frontend admin bar to the customizer, instead of the backend.</p>\n<p>In the future, Halsey plans to integrate theme installation into the customizer, but this is a larger effort that will be added to the project in a later release. Coming up with a UI that doesn&#8217;t make this a cramped and inconvenient experience is going to be a challenge.</p>\n<p>For more technical details on the proposed core changes and merge implementation, check out Halsey&#8217;s post on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/11/customizer-theme-switcher-feature-plugin-merge-proposal/" target="_blank">Make/Core blog</a>. If you want to test out the new UI for theme switching, you can download the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-theme-switcher/" target="_blank">Customizer Theme Switcher</a> plugin from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The feature plugin merge window will be closing the week of February 25th, and the official release is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-2-project-schedule/" target="_blank">targeted for the week of April 22nd</a>.

I asked him how the city was doing as if he were a traveler who had visited someplace exotic &#8212; &#8220;How is it <em>over there</em>?&#8221; (As an investor he probably sees the crazier side of the city, since part of his job is looking at hundreds of companies, the vast majority of which will fail, and trying to pick a few winners.)</p>\n<p>Despite getting near-daily meeting requests, I don&#8217;t currently have any plans to visit San Francisco. I was there in June for a few days for Foo Camp and for drinks with <a href="http://www.tommarioni.com/">the artist Tom Marioni</a>. I returned for <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco in October</a>, and again a few weeks ago for <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scoble&#8217;s</a> 50th birthday party and a board meeting. But the couple-times-a-year rhythm seems to be enough for me. I&#8217;m enjoying the distance a bit, in fact.</p>\n<p>There has been plenty written about the bubble culture in SF right now, including on <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Is-the-antitech-movement-obsolete-6067623.php">the antitech movement that never really took off</a>. <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/03/evolution-of-san-francisco/">It&#8217;s a topic I already blogged about in 2013</a>. But I was curious to unpack my own thoughts about being away from it all.</p>\n<p>What I don&#8217;t miss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too many meetings &#8212; every possible company is there, and everyone wants to meet.</li>\n<li>High prices for everything, from groceries to cocktails. Not even going to talk <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/12/how-paul-graham-is-wrong/">about the real estate market and rentals</a>.</li>\n<li>It takes forever to get across the city, even though it&#8217;s only 7 miles.</li>\n<li>The public transit, while workable, pales in comparison to other places like NYC.</li>\n<li>The weather isn&#8217;t bad, until you drive to Palo Alto or Marin and notice how much nicer it is there. (Or take a one-hour flight to Los Angeles or San Diego.)</li>\n<li>This is anecdotal, but I feel like cell phone service is terrible, especially for making calls. Calls are unintelligible and drop frequently. I think this is why everyone texts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any problem with the social scene; SF might be tech-heavy, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to get out of the tech bubble. Many forget that San Francisco is home to a ton of people working for non-profits, in fashion, finance, bio-tech, art, and music.</p>\n<p>What I miss, deeply: <strong>the people.</strong> Some of my favorite people, professionally and personally, are in the Bay Area, and that&#8217;s the thing that will draw me back someday. I&#8217;m lucky that I can catch up with folks when they travel, like <a href="http://janekim.org/">Jane</a> or <a href="http://tonyconrad.wordpress.com/">Tony</a> in New York or <a href="http://om.co/">Om</a> in Italy. Of course the Automattic headquarters is there, along with some great colleagues, but I can also catch up with them at meetups.</p>\n<p>I miss how much <strong>technology permeates the culture</strong> there, from billboards to services like Uber or <a href="https://postmates.com/">Postmates</a> (or <a href="https://munchery.com/">Munchery</a> or <a href="https://www.spoonrocket.com/">Spoonrocket</a>) that today seem like conveniences, but will be the basis of something very meaningful down the line. You can feel like you&#8217;re living in the future there. Internet speeds seem to be getting better, too &#8212;  local ISPs like <a href="https://webpass.net/">Webpass</a> and <a href="https://www.monkeybrains.net/">Monkeybrains</a> are leading the way, but even my Comcast account there delivers 120mbps.</p>\n<p>I miss being able to run along the water, and the close proximity to lots of beautiful nature areas (granted I didn&#8217;t take much advantage of those when I was still around). The quality of light is really nice &#8212; when you can see it. Restaurants, though tending toward pricey, offer great ingredients and quality.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can&#8217;t deny it&#8217;s a city of hustlers.

A recommendation for Iseulde’s work in this field was also received from several key WordPress people, who have been impressed with the things she has done for the last year since she first started contributing on a volunteer basis,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>For the past five years, SiteGround has been actively involved with supporting the project by sponsoring community events, dedicating employees to help with event orgranization, and sending speakers to share their knowledge at WordCamps around the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We also already have a great relationship with Mario Peshev, who is contributing to the core on a part-time basis sponsored by our company,&#8221; Kesova said. This experience helped with the company&#8217;s decision to sponsor Van Dorpe as a full-time contributor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What truly won us after we had personally met her, was that she is not just a capable WordPress developer, but she is also a great fit for our company culture,&#8221; Kesova said. &#8220;She has the same passion for quality and efficiency that drives SiteGround.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What does a full-time WordPress core contributor do?</h3>\n<p>SiteGround isn&#8217;t the first hosting company to sponsor an employee&#8217;s time for working on the WordPress project. WP Engine, Dreamhost, and a handful of others have been doing so for the past several years. The job varies, depending on the amount of time the company can lend and the contributor&#8217;s areas of specialty and interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As part of the SiteGround team Iseulde will be working full time contributing to WordPress core and helping with some maintenance tasks,&#8221; Kesova said. &#8220;She has some great ideas about improvements in the WordPress backend, including the editor and the media manager, and she will be also doing some support work for WordPress by reviewing and closing tickets and patches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van Dorpe, originally from Belgium, will be working remotely from her current home in Glasgow, Scotland. SiteGround&#8217;s main headquarters are in Sofia, Bulgaria, but it also has two offices in Bulgaria and one in Spain. The company is in the process of hiring its first American employee and plans to open an office in the USA soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a web hosting company, we are aware of the big significance open source projects like WordPress have for our business, by helping people build their websites on top of the hosting service we provide,&#8221; Kesova said. &#8220;That is why we believe it is our duty to support such projects in a meaningful way that can help further their development.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 18:55:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Post Status: The WordPress REST API";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://poststatus.com/?p=8643";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22527:"<p>The WordPress REST API project is the most exciting project for the platform since custom post types were introduced in WordPress 2.9 and 3.0. I really believe that.</p>\n<p>While the project is under a major rewrite and not yet slated for a specific core release, it can be really confusing to figure out what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what the new API is, why it matters, and go over the state of the API to answer some common questions I&#8217;ve seen.</p>\n<h3>What is a JSON REST API?</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by defining the acronyms. It may seem tedious for experienced developers, but it&#8217;s a good way to get us in the right mindset.</p>\n<h4>API: Application Program Interface</h4>\n<p>APIs have a broad definition. Any program is an API. When you have some form of construct in a programming language &#8212; like PHP for example &#8212; where the construct makes it possible to perform a programming task, that&#8217;s a good way to think of an API.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use custom post types as an example. WordPress has a custom post types API. Really, it&#8217;s just a significant chunk of code that makes previously difficult tasks simpler. Now, you can create all new types of content &#8212; that mimic the content structure for posts and pages &#8212; with just a few lines of code.</p>\n<p>The core team created a programming interface to make that possible. That&#8217;s a layman&#8217;s definition for an API.</p>\n<h4>JSON: JavaScript Object Notation</h4>\n<p>JSON is a preferred format for structuring data so that a variety of applications can read it. You can create JSON formatted data from one programming language and read and process it from another. It&#8217;s similar to XML, but seemingly universally preferred over XML.</p>\n<p>JSON makes communication between something like WordPress and something like a mobile app completely possible, as JSON is a common data format between them, so that you can create data on the WordPress side and return it in JSON, so that the data can be easily read on the mobile app side. Such relationships don&#8217;t have to be between WordPress and a mobile app; it could be nearly anything, meaning &#8220;WordPress as an app platform&#8221; becomes much more realistic.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8687" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-8687" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/json-api-data-752x460.jpg" alt="A JSON blurb, at least how it looks when you go straight to the URL" width="752" height="460" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A JSON blurb, at least how it looks when you go straight to the URL</p></div>\n<p>JSON looks terrifying if you see it &#8220;raw&#8221;. For instance, Post Status has the WordPress REST API enabled, so if you go to <a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-json/posts">https://poststatus.com/wp-json/posts</a> you can see my recent posts in a JSON format. This isn&#8217;t pretty to the human eye, but for a programming language, it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>\n<h4>REST: Representational State Transfer</h4>\n<p>A REST API is an architectural preference. Most REST APIs, including WordPress&#8217;, are based on HTTP. This means that the primary actions of the REST API are HTTP actions: <code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>.</p>\n<p>So, with a REST API, we are reading or manipulating data using HTTP.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia kindly defines RESTful APIs better than I can, namely with a definition based upon the restraints on the API itself:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Web service APIs that adhere to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints">REST architectural constraints</a> are called RESTful. HTTP based RESTful APIs are defined with these aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>base <a class="mw-redirect" title="URI" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI">URI</a>, such as <code>http://example.com/resources/</code></li>\n<li>an <a title="Internet media type" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">Internet media type</a> for the data. This is often <a title="JSON" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> but can be any other valid Internet media type (e.g. XML, Atom, microformats, images, etc.)</li>\n<li>standard <a class="mw-redirect" title="HTTP method" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_method">HTTP methods</a> (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE)</li>\n<li>hypertext links to reference state</li>\n<li>hypertext links to reference related resources<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These restrictions serve as standards that anyone working with a RESTful API can expect to exist. So, in my case, I&#8217;m utilizing both the WP API and the Mailchimp API on Post Status. Interacting with either feels similar, because they&#8217;ve placed similar constraints on themselves.</p>\n<h3>What is the WordPress REST API?</h3>\n<p>Now we know what a JSON REST API is, so we can better define what the WordPress one is.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">The WordPress REST API is a common data and programming interface that abstracts the reading and writing of information for WordPress from the WordPress application as we&#8217;ve previously known it.</span> Now, developers working with WordPress don&#8217;t have to know that much about WordPress.</p>\n<h3>How can the WordPress REST API be used?</h3>\n<p>Developers will be able to perform nearly all the data manipulation and data reading functions that are possible with PHP, with the new API. What&#8217;s that mean? It means everything.</p>\n<h4>Ditching WordPress on the front-end</h4>\n<p>With the JSON API, the frontend of WordPress doesn&#8217;t have to be WordPress at all. For example, developers can completely bypass the WordPress templating engine using the API. They can even keep the backend of WordPress and the front-end of the website on completely different server stacks, because they just need to read the data using the API.</p>\n<p>There are already many websites doing this around the web. Some of them use custom APIs they built themselves, and others are using the new WordPress REST API. Let&#8217;s discuss a couple of examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The New York Times uses the WordPress REST API for a variety of things. They are able to use the API in combination with their proprietary CMS. This allows them to pull WordPress data for placement on the Times&#8217; homepage and other places very easily. They&#8217;re also using the REST API for their live event coverage, like this <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/liveblog">elections live blog</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/">Bloomberg Politics</a> uses WordPress to publish, but based on the front-end of the website, you&#8217;d never know it. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re using the official WordPress REST API, but they could.</li>\n<li><a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> uses WordPress to publish, but their front-end is not WordPress at all. This is also a custom implementation, as they made the switch before the official REST API was even underway.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are three examples of news sites using REST APIs for the front-end. But the applications go much, much farther than that.</p>\n<h4>WordPress as an application</h4>\n<p>If you want to see a prime case study, watch K. Adam White&#8217;s presentation from WordCamp San Francisco 2014, where he talks about <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/11/03/k-adam-white-wordpress-in-weird-places-content-management-for-node-using-rest/">how his team used WordPress as the CMS for a node.js app</a>. This really highlights the potential I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p>Looking through the resulting <a href="https://github.com/kadamwhite/expresspress">ExpressPress repo</a> that K. Adam highlights in his presentation is an educational and fascinating experience.</p>\n<h4>Custom WordPress admins</h4>\n<p>WordPress administration doesn&#8217;t have to use the WordPress admin as we know it. With the REST API, you can create, edit, and delete content just as well as you can read it.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the WordPress admin itself may be re-written on top of the REST API. Using the API, creating completely custom administration panels will be easier than ever before. This will allow developers to create catered administration experiences for a particular application.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8686" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-8686" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/json-api-wpcom-post-editor-752x561.jpg" alt="The WordPress.com editor" width="752" height="561" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The WordPress.com editor</p></div>\n<p>For example, WordPress.com has already utilized their own REST API (which will hopefully be a similar implementation to the core API once it&#8217;s included) to create a custom admin experience for their blogging platform.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8685" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-8685" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wp-api-happy-tables-752x490.jpg" alt="The Happy Tables editor" width="752" height="490" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Happy Tables editor</p></div>\n<p>Other services, like <a href="http://happytables.com">Happy Tables</a> for instance, have also created custom WordPress admins. Doing this in the future will be easier than ever because the REST API integrates existing WordPress functionality to the API, so that developers don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<h4>App integrations</h4>\n<p>Additionally to custom web integrations, WordPress will be able to talk to apps easier than ever before as well.</p>\n<p>Previous apps that interfaced with WordPress would most often use XML-RPC. With the REST API, the ability to perform complex functions in a reliable manner is increased. It will be simpler than ever to create a mobile app that can not only read WordPress data, but also  create, edit, and delete that data.</p>\n<p>The entire mobile app can be written in Objective-C, Swift, or whatever programming language, and interface with WordPress.</p>\n<p>An example of this in action is <a href="http://apppresser.com/">AppPresser</a> (<a title="AppPresser: A foundation for using WordPress to make mobile apps" href="https://poststatus.com/appresser-wordpress-mobile-apps/">which I covered</a> when it launched). AppPresser has created an application framework that integrates with the WordPress REST API to make creating WordPress apps for individual sites quite simple.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not limited to app creation with a tool like AppPresser. People can now have one data-storage area (WordPress) that can power both the website and an app, and that is a powerful feature. Also, the apps can talk to and write to the WordPress database directly through the API.</p>\n<p>We will see dozens of WordPress apps and admin integrations over the next few years. We could even see whole startups build apps with WordPress as a base layer.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">WordPress can provide an excellent foundation for user management, content management, and much more &#8212; reducing the amount of work a startup creating a prototype mobile application have to recreate themselves.</span> The REST API makes it so a mobile app can look completely custom and also use a tool as widely distributed as WordPress to power many of the internals.</p>\n<h3>When is the WordPress REST API going to be in core?</h3>\n<p>The REST API is under heavy development, and is also between major versions that will sever backward compatibility. That has made the state of the API confusing.</p>\n<p>The REST API hasn&#8217;t been slated for a particular release, though it is officially active <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">for the &#8220;feature as plugin&#8221;</a> model. The goal is for it to hit core some time in 2015, so probably between WordPress 4.3 and 4.5. I&#8217;d guess closer to 4.5, as there will need to be a lot of testing once the new stable version comes out.</p>\n<h3>Keeping up with development</h3>\n<p>If you want to keep track of the WordPress REST API development, there are a variety of ways to do so, though finding the proper channels can be a challenge at the moment.</p>\n<p>First off, know that a major new version is being finalized as we speak, so there is disparity between 1.1.x and the upcoming version for information, code, and documentation. The version under development &#8212; and is a significant restructuring &#8212; has been under development for nearly seven months.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/">WordPress.org official plugin page</a> is somewhat closely synchronized with the latest 1.x release, though it is a few commits behind. The plugin is authored by Ryan McCue, who is the project lead and the initial author of the plugin, as it was his Google Summer of Code project for the first iteration. The WordPress.org page could also use some updating to make it more obvious that it&#8217;s the official REST API plugin for the WordPress project.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WP API Github</a> is where active issue tracking, version management, and releases are being handled. The API has its own account on Github, rather than being a part of the WordPress account, as there are adjacent repos to the actual API and it wasn&#8217;t originally guaranteed to be in core.</p>\n<p>The key to understanding the various states of the WP REST API is to think in terms of <strong>Develop</strong>, <strong>Master</strong>, and <strong>Stable</strong> versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/">WordPress.org plugin repository</a> is the Stable version of the WP API.</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master">Github Master branch</a> is where a Beta version of the next release is managed.</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/develop">Github Develop branch</a> is where the active development occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re using the WordPress REST API in production, you should use the WordPress.org version only</strong>. The Github Master and Development versions should be used for development and testing only.</p>\n<h3>Improvements coming in the rewrite</h3>\n<p>The long development cycle for the new version of the REST API is because it&#8217;s a signifcant rewrite for the project.</p>\n<p>Based on feedback and real-world use cases, the team was able to identify necessary improvements that needed to happen.</p>\n<p>There have been many, many changes in this version, but a couple of big ones are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New functions have been added to allow for registration of custom endpoints with namespaces and versions. Rachel Baker <a href="https://gist.github.com/krogsgard/c3975a2ff449f20e56f3">shared this gist with me</a> that showcases that. This means themes and plugins will be able to add to and extend the API, offering significantly more power to it.</li>\n<li>Comment creation and edit handling have been added in the rewrite.</li>\n<li>The team has also started work on support for options endpoints to be able to view, edit, and create general site options, which would make complete site management possible with the API, in addition to content management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The changes in the current development cycle have taken a long time, and have required some significant architectural changes, but are very much worth the long term benefits.</p>\n<h3>Contributors to the WordPress REST API</h3>\n<p>There have been <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/graphs/contributors">49 code contributors</a> to the REST API project on Github. It&#8217;s already a huge community effort. However, there are some folks that are really driving the project forward.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8684" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wp-api-contributors-752x484.png" alt="wp-api-contributors" width="752" height="484" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue">Ryan McCue</a>: Ryan is the overall project lead, and is generally steering the ship. This all started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project and he is still the lead. He works for <a href="http://hmn.md/">Human Made</a>, primarily on Happy Tables.</li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rachelbaker">Rachel Baker</a>: Rachel is a project lead, and is doing a great deal of development, as well as education and evangelism. She works for <a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> as a Senior Web Engineer.</li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber">Daniel Bachhuber</a>: Daniel is in day to day conversations and also commits a lot of code to the project. He works for himself and is the interim engineering director at <a href="http://fusion.net/">Fusion</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle">Joe Hoyle</a>: Joe is in day to day conversations and also commits a lot of code to the project. He is a co-founder of <a href="http://hmn.md/">Human Made</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though I highlight these four contributors, but there are a whopping 400 people watching the #core-restapi channel in Slack, and there are 49 code contributors on Github. Everyone deserves a huge round of applause that&#8217;s taken part in the strategic, code, education aspects of this project.</p>\n<p>And this is all before it goes into the core development cycle. Once this gets slated for a specific release, it&#8217;s going to get an insane amount of attention to make sure it&#8217;s ready for prime time and the millions of WordPress installs out there.</p>\n<h3>Meetings and blogs for the REST API</h3>\n<p>The REST API has a standing channel and weekly meeting in WordPress Slack, as well as two blogs you can keep track of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>#core-restapi on WordPress Slack is where day to day communication occurs, and a feed of commit activity also goes into that channel. The weekly meeting is also here &#8212; and is actually held twice per week &#8212; at 23:00 UTC on Mondays and Wednesdays.</li>\n<li>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/json-api/">json-api tag on Make WordPress Core</a> is where blog posts about the API go. However, this has been rarely used, and is primarily just for release information.</li>\n<li>Frequent meeting notes and other discussions are posted on <a href="http://make.wp-api.org/">make.wp-api.org</a>, which is an 02 blog (P2&#8217;s mysterious successor).</li>\n<li>Documentation can be viewed on <a href="http://wp-api.org">wp-api.org</a>. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that <strong>the docs on the main website are for the stable WordPress plugin</strong>, not the Develop branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Basics for using the WordPress REST API</h3>\n<p>The new API will make sense to people familiar with other REST APIs. However, if you are new to such things, even with the documentation you can easily get lost. I know I did.</p>\n<p>I will have a lot more resources for members soon, but I&#8217;ll try and give a quick intro to reading data now.</p>\n<p>The first thing to remember is that it&#8217;s very important to know if you will be reading data only or reading and changing data. If you are reading data from your own website, and using it on the same website, you don&#8217;t need to worry about authentication. If you are changing, adding, or deleting data, then you need to authenticate with the website you are making changes to.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s show a few simple examples of reading data with <code>GET</code>.</p>\n<p>A URL to pull content from Post Status would look like this:</p>\n<a href="https://gist.github.com/c983960972582c6ec2c0" target="_blank"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>To pull content with <code>WP_Query</code> parameters you&#8217;re used to, you could do it like this:</p>\n<a href="https://gist.github.com/c983960972582c6ec2c0" target="_blank"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>To pull content of a custom post type, you can do it like this:</p>\n<a href="https://gist.github.com/c983960972582c6ec2c0" target="_blank"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>And to pull content of a custom post type with those same <code>WP_Query</code> parameters, it looks like this:</p>\n<a href="https://gist.github.com/c983960972582c6ec2c0" target="_blank"><em>View this code snippet on GitHub.</em></a>\n<p>What you see returned in those URLs is the JSON data we&#8217;re going after. Go ahead and put one of those URLs in a browser tab to see the return data.</p>\n<p>You can see how the method for grabbing that data feels familiar to using <code>WP_Query</code> for a standard WordPress loop. If you don&#8217;t specify a parameter, the defaults to <code>WP_Query</code> will be used.</p>\n<p>These URLs return that data, but obviously you&#8217;ll want to get that data programatically. You can do this within a WordPress install (or outside) with two common methods: PHP or AJAX.</p>\n<p>Handling the data will be similar to handling any other JSON data. I&#8217;ll have more on doing this with WordPress at a later date, but in the meantime you may enjoy <a href="http://torquemag.io/introduction-wordpress-new-universal-connector-json-rest-api/">Josh Pollock&#8217;s introduction</a> to using the REST API.</p>\n<p>Now, of course, you can query far more than posts, as the <a href="http://wp-api.org">WP API website</a> notes, but I just wanted to introduce the concepts.</p>\n<p>The API allows you to manage pretty much anything: posts, pages, custom post types, users, media, taxonomies, or even overall site data.</p>\n<h3>This is just the beginning</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve hardly given a proper introduction to actually using the new WordPress REST API. That will have to wait until another time. That said, you should know have a pretty good understanding of what this project is, what it means for WordPress, and where to go to get started with the new API.</p>\n<p>I highly encourage you to educate yourself on this API, as well as experiment with it. You can use the Stable branch in production projects (like I do here on Post Status), but it would be really great to get more people testing and using the API in general so that when it ships with WordPress it will be as good as it can be.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 22:31:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Matt: Amazing Dance";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44669";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://ma.tt/2015/02/amazing-dance/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:183:"<p></p>\n<p>Incredible music (&#8220;Take Me To Church&#8221; by Hozier), incredible artist (the dancer, Sergei Polunin), and incredible photographer / director (David LaChapelle).</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 19:08:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: Tackling the Issue of WordPress Derivative Works";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=38822";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wptavern.com/tackling-the-issue-of-wordpress-derivative-works";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6882:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GPLFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[38822]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24825" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GPLFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C200" alt="GPL License Plate Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benfrantzdale/170212544/">BenFrantzDale</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>In 2009-10, there <a title="http://wordpress.tv/2010/07/15/mixergy-interview-pearson-mullenweg/" href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/07/15/mixergy-interview-pearson-mullenweg/">was an intense debate</a> between the co-creator of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, and the founder of DIY Themes, Chris Pearson. The debate centered on whether or not Thesis needed to be 100% GPL licensed. Thesis lifted lines of code from the core of WordPress, which <a title="https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/" href="https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/">some people claimed</a> made Thesis a derivative of WordPress. Pearson disagreed with the assessment which lead Mullenweg to insinuate <a title="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/" href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/">he would take the matter to court</a>.</p>\n<p>Five years after that memorable debate, Richard Best of WP and Legal Stuff, <a title="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/wordpress-themes-gpl-conundrum-derivative-works/" href="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/wordpress-themes-gpl-conundrum-derivative-works/">has published a thorough analysis</a> of WordPress themes, the GPL license, and what is a derivative work. His post is a breath of fresh air and the best I&#8217;ve read so far on the subject. Best doesn&#8217;t sell themes or plugins in the WordPress ecosystem giving him a neutral position to discuss the matter. He also has a legal background, but does not offer legal advice through his site.</p>\n<p>Determining what defines a derivative work is complex, but according to Best, no one truly knows the answer to the question:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reason we don’t truly know the answer is that the courts haven’t decided a case that is squarely on point (there are potentially analogous cases, of course, but – as far as I’m aware – no GPL or similar case directly on point).  It is only the courts (in the absence of legislative intervention) that can finally determine the matter.</p>\n<p>Courts might apply what some might say are orthodox notions of what it means for something to be a derivative work or they might incrementally (some might say dangerously) develop the law on this point but we just don’t know. And even if the courts of one country made a definitive ruling on the point, courts in other countries – where other lawsuits might be commenced – could decide differently. As a result, uncertainty remains.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The debate against Thesis never went to court, but it spawned several conversations throughout the WordPress community, <a title="http://www.chipbennett.net/2010/07/20/wordpress-themes-gpl-and-copyright-case-law/" href="http://www.chipbennett.net/2010/07/20/wordpress-themes-gpl-and-copyright-case-law/"> like this one from Chip Bennett</a>. This is why <a title="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/#comment-1584821297" href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/#comment-1584821297">some people</a> rallied for a court case to settle the matter once and for all. As far as WordPress is concerned, I think it&#8217;s unlikely a court case will ever take place.</p>\n<h2>Influence Instead of Lawyers</h2>\n<p>Mullenweg has other ways of influencing people to license their WordPress products 100% GPL which doesn&#8217;t require a lawyer. A good example is <a title="http://designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed" href="http://designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed">when Jake Caputo was banned</a> from speaking or participating at WordCamps because he didn&#8217;t license his themes 100% GPL on ThemeForest.</p>\n<p>After going back and forth in <a title="http://marketblog.envato.com/news/survey-results-about-gpl-opt-in-choice/" href="http://marketblog.envato.com/news/survey-results-about-gpl-opt-in-choice/">public debates</a>, ThemeForest <a title="http://marketblog.envato.com/general/100-gpl-option-now-available-plus-woothemes-arrives/" href="http://marketblog.envato.com/general/100-gpl-option-now-available-plus-woothemes-arrives/">eventually added the ability</a> for authors to choose between split-license and 100% GPL. After changing the license on all of his products to 100% GPL, Caputo was allowed to speak at WordCamps again. It&#8217;s this type of influence that prevents arguments from reaching the court system.</p>\n<h2>Only a Court Can Decide</h2>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t many posts these days debating the merits of GPL and WordPress. Best does a great job explaining why (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the GPL/theme debate has reached the stage where it’s fair to say that a significant proportion of the WordPress community now frowns upon premium theme providers who either don’t GPL-license at all or (probably to a lesser extent) split-license their themes. That might not be good for business and that, for some, may be the bottom line.</p>\n<p>For some people, this frowning may be caused by a particular view of what the GPL requires <em>but</em> for others – and I think this is a particularly important point – it may be caused by a recognition of the enormous opportunities that WordPress makes possible and the open source spirit and generosity that pervades much of the WordPress community. <strong>I think we’ve reached the stage where, for some people, this is more about a community norm than it is about a strict reading of the GPL </strong>(not to mention the tedium of listening to more and more competing GPL arguments when, ultimately, only a court can decide).</p></blockquote>\n<p>If a debate like the one in 2010 were to happen again, I think we&#8217;d see a huge outcry from every corner of the community for a court case to settle the matter.

The inclusion of this feature in themes, as opposed to plugins, has long been a hotly contested issue among theme developers.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org Theme Review team admin Justin Tadlock <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/02/10/custom-css-boxes-in-themes/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that the team has agreed upon new guidelines for the inclusion of CSS boxes. He summarized the conclusions following the debate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s preferred that theme authors leave this feature to plugins.</li>\n<li>However, it is allowed if handled safely.</li>\n<li>The edit_theme_options capability is required (like all theme options).</li>\n<li>The wp_filter_nohtml_kses(), wp_strip_all_tags(), or equivalent function must be used to sanitize the data before it’s saved into the database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main issue here is sanitizing the CSS to make sure it&#8217;s safe to store in the database. The guidelines do not cover validating the CSS, as that is less of a safety concern.</p>\n<p>While adding custom CSS boxes still falls within theme territory, it is best to consider relegating this feature to a plugin in order to keep your theme safe and lean. If you still wish to offer this feature in your theme, Tadlock <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/02/10/custom-css-boxes-in-themes/" target="_blank">posted sample code</a> that will provide a good starting place for adding a custom CSS box to WordPress&#8217; native customizer.</p>\n<p>Commercial theme authors who want to keep pace with WordPress.org theme review requirements will want to review the updated guidelines. The theme review team recommends using a plugin, such as <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/custom-css/" target="_blank">Jetpack&#8217;s custom CSS module</a>, as a safe alternative to allowing the theme to save custom CSS to the database.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 23:53:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: iThemes to Host Free Online Training Event: Intro to WordPress Web Design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=38746";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-to-host-free-online-training-event-intro-to-wordpress-web-design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2962:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ithemes-training.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[38746]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ithemes-training.jpg?resize=932%2C445" alt="ithemes-training" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38816" /></a></p>\n<p>iThemes will be conducting a free online training event next week for those who are interested in getting started with WordPress.

Bradley has been working with the company for the past five years to build out a library of 600+ instructional videos for the community surrounding iThemes&#8217; products. A chat room will be available for discussion and Q&amp;A during the the online event.</p>\n<p>iThemes CEO Cory Miller began investing in the creation of training resources years ago after noticing that a lack of quality WordPress education material was putting an extra burden on his support staff. &#8220;We started this free online workshop several years ago in response to seeing many of the same questions being asked in our support area year after year,&#8221; Miller said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We felt our customers weren&#8217;t able to make meaningful progress in learning the basics of WordPress web design because there weren&#8217;t good resources to do so. The need is there and it is great, in particular for online learning like this. It&#8217;s part of our contribution to building up our customers, but also the greater WordPress community,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The event is not just for iThemes customers but is open to anyone. If you can&#8217;t attend the training sessions live, iThemes plans to make the recordings available on its blog after the event.

The project was started in July 2013 by <a href="http://thefragens.com/" target="_blank">Andy Fragen</a>, a trauma surgeon and plugin developer. Over the past two years GitHub Updater has received improvements from 14 <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>Fragen&#8217;s work on GitHub Updater makes it possible for developers to stay in their <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-vs-github-for-hosting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes" target="_blank">preferred GitHub/Bitbucket workflow</a> and still ship updates for plugins and themes to their users. After reading about how <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher is extending WordPress&#8217; built-in auto updater to deploy remotely hosted themes and plugins</a>, Fragen was inspired to investigate the possibility of adding remote installation of WordPress extensions to his GitHub Updater.</p>\n<p>He now has the <code>develop</code> branch of the project working to successfully install both public and private GitHub or Bitbucket repositories remotely. &#8220;I must confess, the hardest part was getting everything in the Settings API functioning,&#8221; Fragen said.</p>\n<p>With the help of some code from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/" target="_blank">WordPress Zero Spam</a> plugin by Ben Marshall, and a few lines from <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation</a> by Thomas Griffin, he was able to get a tabbed settings interface in place in addition to the plugin dependency portion of the task.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After setting up the tabs in the Settings page I was able to simply create the correct endpoint for GitHub and Bitbucket,&#8221; Fragen said. &#8220;I thought allowing for private repository remote installation might prove more difficult but a couple of modifications in other parts of the plugin made this relatively painless. It certainly makes downloading a repo from GitHub, renaming it correctly, and then uploading it a single-click experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater" target="_blank">GitHub Updater</a> is <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/issues/34" target="_blank">not allowed in the WordPress.org directory</a>, as the guidelines forbid official plugins from allowing updates from anywhere outside of WordPress.org. Developers usually opt for using the GitHub Updater when they want to host their plugins on GitHub/Bitbucket, or need to provide updates for private repositories.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://thefragens.com/2015/02/github-updater-and-remote-installation/" target="_blank">4.1 release of GitHub Updater</a> will include both remote installation and automatic updating in one package. If you want to test the functionality now, you can check out the <code>develop</code> branch.

The group is made up of more than 15 members of the WordPress community who have experience in onboarding clients, training clients, and work with new users on a regular basis. According to the announcement, the group&#8217;s main task is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The group will be tasked with helping to identify common pain points new users might experience using WordPress. The hope is to (re)invigorate the conversation about making NUX a priority in core decision-making. We’ll work together to identify problems and recommend solutions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With regards to 4.2, the group will brainstorm actionable goals and make recommendations to improve the new user experience throughout the WordPress backend.

If you like Jetpack but don&#8217;t want to connect to WordPress.com, there&#8217;s a new plugin that makes it easy to use the features that don&#8217;t require a connection.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/unplug-jetpack/" target="_blank">Unplug Jetpack</a> was created by WordPress developer <a href="http://tannermoushey.com/" target="_blank">Tanner Moushey</a>. With the plugin activated, you won&#8217;t be required to connect to WordPress.com unless you need to use Site stats, Publicize, Related Posts, etc. If you don&#8217;t see the module you&#8217;re looking for among the others, that means that it likely requires a WordPress.com connection in order to use it.</p>\n<p>The Unplug Jetpack plugin essentially puts Jetpack into development mode. Development mode was introduced in Jetpack <a href="http://jetpack.me/2013/03/28/jetpack-dev-mode-release/" target="_blank">2.2.1</a> to help developers with local testing. It allows you to use features that do not require a connection to WordPress.com servers. Ordinarily, turning on development mode requires adding a line to your wp-config.php file or employing the filter via a plugin.</p>\n<p>Unplug Jetpack is convenient, because it allows you to turn development mode on/off using a plugin. It uses the Jetpack-supported method for doing this and consists of just a couple lines of code:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">\nfunction uj_init() {\n	add_filter( ''jetpack_development_mode'', ''__return_true'' );\n}\nadd_action( ''plugins_loaded'', ''uj_init'' );\n</pre>\n<p>When asked whether or not the plugin offers a performance boost as opposed to using non-WordPress.com dependent modules with the connection to WordPress.com, Moushey <a href="https://twitter.com/tannermoushey/status/564189285071351808" target="_blank">said</a> that it&#8217;s unlikely to have a significant performance impact. &#8220;But that is not really the point of this,&#8221; he said. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter &#8211; being able to use Jetpack&#8217;s code without the requirement of connecting to a third party. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/unplug-jetpack/" target="_blank">Unplug Jetpack</a> lets you do that with the flip of a switch.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Feb 2015 18:22:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 08:06:55 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"224660";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 08:00:22 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20150223075958";}', 'no');

Using the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases we exemplify the diversity of the down regulation process, and concentrate on two sorting steps whose molecular details are emerging. These are the Eps15-mediated sorting to clathrin-coated regions of the plasma membrane and the c-Cbl-mediated targeting of receptors to lysosomal degradation. Like in yeast cells, sorting involves not only protein phosphorylation but also conjugation of ubiquitin molecules. The involvement of other molecules is reviewed and recent observations that challenge the negative regulatory role of endocytosis are described. Finally, we discuss the relevance of receptor down regulation to cancer therapy.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying endocytosis and sorting ERbB recptor tryosine kinasis', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'article-1', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:04:26', '2013-07-08 08:04:26', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?page_id=223', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In spite of 10- to 1000-fold lower binding affinity to their respective receptors, the viral ligands are mitogenically equivalent or even more potent than their mammalian counterparts. This remarkable enhancement of cell growth is due to attenuation of receptor degradation and ubiquitination, which leads to sustained signal transduction.

However, some ligands are more potent than others, although they bind to the same direct receptor. In addition, signaling by receptor heterodimers is superior to homodimers. We addressed the mechanism underlying these two features of signal tuning by using three ligands: EGF; transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha); and their chimera, denoted E4T, which act on cells singly expressing ErbB-1 as a weak, a strong, and a very strong agonist, respectively. Co-expression of ErbB-2, a developmentally important co-receptor whose expression is frequently elevated in human cancers, specifically potentiated EGF signaling to the level achieved by TGFalpha, an effect that was partially mimicked by ErbB-3. Analysis of the mechanism underlying this trans-potentiation implied that EGF-driven homodimers of ErbB-1 are destined for intracellular degradation, whereas the corresponding heterodimers with ErbB-2 or with ErbB-3, dissociate in the early endosome. As a consequence, in the presence of either co-receptor, ErbB-1 is recycled to the cell surface and its signaling is enhanced. This latter route is followed by TGFalpha-driven homodimers of ErbB-1, and also by E4T-bound receptors, whose signaling is further enhanced by repeated cycles of binding and dissociation from the receptors. We conclude that alternative endocytic routes of homo- and hetero-dimeric receptor complexes may contribute to tuning and diversification of signal transduction. In addition, the ability of ErbB-2 to shunt ligand-activated receptors to recycling may explain, in part, its oncogenic\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf</a>\r\n', 'Differential endocytic routing of homo- and hetero-dimeric ErbB tyrosine kinases confers signaling superiority to receptor heterodimers.', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'differential-endocytic-routing-of-homo-and-hetero-dimeric-erbb-tyrosine-kinases-confers-signaling-superiority-to-receptor-heterodimers', '', '', '2013-07-24 13:21:22', '2013-07-24 13:21:22', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?page_id=256', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2. The observed superior ability of ErbB-2 to form heterodimers, in conjunction with its uniquely high basal tyrosine kinase activity, may explain why ErbB-2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf</a>', 'A hierarchical network of interreceptor interactions determines signal transduction by Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin and epidermal growth factor.', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-hierarchical-network-of-interreceptor-interactions-determines-signal-transduction-by-neu-differentiation-factorneuregulin-and-epidermal-growth-factor', '', '', '2013-07-24 13:21:22', '2013-07-24 13:21:22', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?page_id=258', 0, 'post', '', 0),

A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

More specifically, the 5,700 years since the events of Genesis do not pose a limitation on the age of the universe. This interpretation is supported by a focused examination of passages from Genesis, Psalms and prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Bible and modern science present radically different outlooks on the creation of the earth, and the origins of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Bible appears to state that some 5,700 years ago, the earth, all species of animals and man, were created. Scientific observation suggests that the earth is several billion years old; species on earth evolved over eons of time; and civilizations were extant long before 5,700 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The arguments presented by science, prima facie, appear to be cogent, to the extent that many modern books have been written by religious scientists to prove that the biblical time frame covers a much longer span of time, for example with each of the seven days of Genesis spanning eons of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The present article will present a different view on the events of Genesis, based extensively on the preeminent 12th century commentary, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, Rashi[i].  Further, support for this view will be cited in prayer and a Psalm.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Beginning – "Aw-retz"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Genesis 1:1 “In the Beginning of creating … Land”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first verse of the Bible refers to the creation of “Land”, "Aw-retz" in Hebrew. Land, throughout the Torah refers to a small geographic location, occupied by a group of people sharing common language or ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Land of Canaan”, for example, is an area of land initially occupied by the Canaanites, promised to the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and bequeathed on their descendents. The descendants of the patriarchs were exiled in “Land of Egypt”. The Tigress River is associated with the “Land of Paras”, modern-day Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The word "Aw-retz" in the very first verse that introduces Genesis,  suggests that Genesis is not about creating a universe or even the planet earth, but something different entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Enigma of the Sun and Moon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther support for this understanding that Genesis has nothing to do with the Creation of a universe, is provided by the verse at the end of the first day; “And there was sunset and there was sunrise, one day”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunset and sunrise require man to observe the sun''s position with respect to the earth, a universal definition throughout the Torah, Prophets Writings and Code of Law. In the Code of Jewish Law, for example, laws regarding the onset of the Sabbath are based solely upon sunset observed from the highest point in a given community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day, according to the commentary, the heavenly illuminators were created, but only "fixed" in place until the fourth day[ii]. The literal interpretation of this suggests that sunrise and sunset of days one through three was either non-existent or totally different than the sunset and sunrise of days four through seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of this profound difference between what was observed on day one, versus what was observed on day four, the Bible invariably refers to sunrise and sunset at the end of each of the seven days of Creation; suggesting that sunset and sunrise on each of the seven days of creation were equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf something as fundamental as sunrise and sunset didn''t change during the seven days of Creation, one could conclude that Creation had nothing to do with forming the sun and earth and that the sun and earth were fully extant, in place, on the first day of creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the use of the words sunrise and sunset, suggests that man whose presence is required for the associated observations, was present on the planet from day one of Creation; suggesting that Creation occurred on a populated world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat then is the creation about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis – The Divine Story of the Exodus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis does not appear to be an account of how, or when, the universe was created, but an account of the miraculous events of the Exodus from Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:3 “And He said, Elokim, let there be light".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentary, as will be explained in more detail below, this verse refers to the creation of the pillar of fire that led the Israelite nation in the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Genesis is truly a description of Divine perspective of the holy events surrounding the Exodus should not be surprising as the relationship is specifically noted in the convocation of the wine on the Sabbath; Friday night. The convocation states that the onset of the seventh day of Creation constitutes "a remembrance to the Exodus from Egypt".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnified Creator, Unified Redeemer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:5:”...and there was sunrise, one day”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary notes that the Torah chooses the words “one day” rather than “first day” because the word “one” signifies unity. This Divine unity parallels the Divine unity during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 12:12 “I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night, and I shall strike every firstborn... I the Almighty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revelations of the first day of the Exodus, beginning with death of the first born Egyptians, were performed by the Almighty alone, without angels acting as emissaries of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short span of a article, it is virtually impossible to analyze every aspect of Genesis. However, we will trace the account of the creation of the "illuminators" to provide at least one example of how Genesis may actually be a description of the Divine Investiture and Divine love that lit up the world during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pillar of Fire – The Great Illuminator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:8 “and the Almighty...called the Rekiah, heaven (‘shawma-yim’)".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary cites the word shawmayim (heaven) as being a contraction, inter alia, of the Hebrew words “Fire and water“[iii]. Water is an integral part of the clouds surrounding our plant. Lightning, a product of static electricity generated by cloud movement, is not present in every rain shower. Fire, referring to lightening that is expressed only during certain types rain cloud formation, is not integral to the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary, however, is referring to the Exodus in which the Clouds of Glory lead the Hebrew nation during the Day and the pillar of fire leads the nation by night and later synergistically combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 13:21: “And the Almighty went before them during the day in a Pillar of cloud, to show them the way”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary relates that on the third day of the Exodus[iv], Pharaoh’s spies that accompanied the Hebrew nation thus far, went back to Egypt and informed Pharaoh that the Hebrews has stopped at the edge of the desert at Pi-hahiros and were lost. Concurrent with setting up of the Hebrew camp on the fourth day, the Almighty orders the Clouds of Glory and Pillar of Fire to remain fixed in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 14:5 “and it was told to the king of Egypt that the Holy nation had fled... And He harnessed his chariot and He took his people .." and Pharaoh starts out in pursuit of the Hebrews on the fourth day following the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Four – Fixing the Position of the Illuminators\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:14 “ “Moros”, lights, will be fixed “yehi” in the Rekiah ‘firmament’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary states that in Genesis, the lights were created on the first day, but fixed in place on the fourth day. The moros of Creation correspond to the pillar of fire. The "firmament", "rekiah", which was similarly fixed in place on the fourth day of Creation, corresponds to the Clouds of Glory during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavens of Fire and Water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 14:19-20”... and the Pillar of clouds traveled from in front of them to behind them. And it went between the Hebrew camp and the Egyptian camp..." along with the Pillar of Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of Pharaoh''s attack, the clouds of Glory and the Pillar of Fire synergistically function together during both day and night. The Clouds create impenetrable darkness in the Egyptian camp and the Pillar of Fire lights up the Hebrew camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous actions of the Pillar of Fire and the Clouds of Glory,  is key to understanding the commentary that "Shawmayim" is a mixture of water and fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, in Genesis, not Exodus, the commentary states that the "shawmayim" functioned to catch the “arrows of the night"[v]. What is generally read as "Chetzi", meaning "half", should apparently be read as "Chaytey", the word "arrow" in the construct form, referring to the "arrows of the night". During the Exodus, the commentary tells us that arrows and catapulted objects were slung on the Hebrew camp by Pharaoh''s camp during the night. Only through the miraculous protection of the Clouds of Glory in combination with the Pillar of Fire, was the Hebrew Nation saved from injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Four, Week Two -- Diphtheria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:14 “And He, Elokim, said there will be (yehi) profane lights, "Moros”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis commandment that the Pillar of Fire must remain stationary over the Hebrew encampment on the fourth day of the Exodus, provides the commentary with another opportunity to equate the Exodus with Genesis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentary, the word "yehi" is missing the "v" prefix that designates holiness.[vi]  Most interpretations ignore the inclusion of the word "v''yehi" in the caption of the commentary and suggest that one of the two "v''s" in "Moros" is missing. However, due to the various spellings of "Moros" during Genesis, there is disagreement as to which "v" of the two"v''s" in Moros are missing. The solution appears to be the word "yehi" that earlier included a "v".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA "v" prefix signifies "holiness". The Divine command to the Pillar of Fire to stop in place  should be introduced as “V-Yehi Moros”, “and let there be Holy lights” signifying the great miraculous events related to the Pillar. Instead, the pillar of fire is addressed with the more mundane command, “Yehi Moros”, “let there be profane lights”[vii].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relegation of an outright miracle to the level of the mundane is quite unusual, but related to a specific occurrence; a terrible tragedy that occurred on the fourth day of the next week following the splitting of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 15:23 “And they came to Moros-ah, and they could not drink the waters because they were bitter...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of the week following the splitting of the Red Sea, the Hebrews stopped at a place called “Moros-ah” where the Hebrew nation complained about their thirst. The complaints represent a tremendous breach of faith that become the source for all further complaints and unholy actions throughout the Hebrew sojourn in the desert. The punishment for the complaints at “Moros-ah”, correspondingly were severe, with the Hebrew nation stricken with a plague similar[viii] to diphtheria[ix].  On this basis, the words "yehi Moros" of Genesis are missing the "v" prefix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commentary makes the case that that[x] “Moros-ah”, the stopover on day eleven following the Exodus is grammatically equivalent to “Moros”[xi], the illuminator fixed in the heavens on the fourth day of Genesis; thereby providing further leads that connect Genesis and Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe actually have another source that the world is not limited to a 5,700 year span that can be explored in this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30,000+ Years of Civilization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsalms 105:8: “He [the Creator] remembers his covenant…to the thousandth generation”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          There were only 26 generations between Genesis and Exodus[xii]. From the creation of higher man in Genesis until the completion of higher man''s sojourn on this planet, there is a maximum allotment of 7,000 years. Assuming that each of the 1,000 generations arises on average every 30 to 50 years[xiii], the history of man stretches some 30,000 to 50,000 years, with only the last 200 or less generations occurring during the final 7,000 year period that begins with the creation of higher man in Genesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary[xiv] suggests two answers: A first answer posits that the 1000 generations may have been foreshortened due to the sins of man. This first answer, however, does not spell out that the 1000 generations were shortened specifically by 800 generations or more. If the 1000 generations were shorted by only 10 or even 100 generations, we have at least 700 generations, or about 21,000 to 35,000 unaccounted years during which the Torah was "remembered".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the "shortening" may not refer to the number of generations, but to the lifespan of each generation. This foreshortening  of man''s lifespan to 120 years is specifically stated in the Bible in proximity to the account regarding the generation of Noah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second explanation by the commentary also does little to significantly limit the time span of the 1,000 generations. The commentary states that The Almighty guarded the Bible throughout 1000 generations. This "guarding" could have taken place both prior to and following the bestowal of the Bible at Mount Sinai, stretching about 21,000 plus years prior to the creation of higher man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon the above, it appears that a more primitive humanoid civilization, preceded Genesis. The creation of man during Genesis, appears to be an account of how primitive man was endowed, ex nehilo, with higher intellectual powers, in anticipation of receiving the Bible, and the higher moral code contained therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommemorating the Generations of Man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progression of civilization from primitive man to a single higher man; and from singular higher man present in each generation to a nation of Hebrews gathered at Mount Sinai, is commemorated in the prayer, "Blessed is the one who spoke". The prayer is translates as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who spoke and brought the holy World into being, Blessed is he." \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a reference to the creation of a "Holy World" having the potential to express the Holiness of the Almighty, through adherence to a Holy moral code, the Bible. The elevation of the mundane world to a potentially "Holy World" occurred with the endowment for potential spiritual elevation in a physical plot of land, the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who spoke during holy procreation (oseh)".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to actuate this holiness, the Almighty created a "Holy Man", Adam, the first higher man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word "oseh", as noted above, refers to procreation and, specifically, the procreation of the first higher man that included Divine manifestation through creating a holy vessel in DNA[xv], the transcript of Holy Man''s intellectual faculties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who decreed and followed through",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above stanza recounts how Adam failed to live up to the Divine commandments against eating of the fruit of the "Tree of Good and Evil", forcing the Almighty to mete out the required punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who made Genesis".      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stanza above cannot be referring to the creation of higher man, Adam, which has already been commemorated above. The stanza commemorates the endowment of higher souls to the Israelite nation during the Exodus, an event integrally related to Genesis as noted in relation to the Sabbath convocation above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prayer, "Blessed is the one who spoke", then, commemorates the elevation of a mundane world with the Divine manifestation in the Holy Land, prior to the creation of Adam. This elevation of the Holy Land, however was only a potential that could not be actualized until Holy Adam was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the creation of Holy Adam and his downfall, the actualization of the Holiness of the Land promised to our forefathers was delayed until the true "Genesis", creation of a holy nation, following the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2,488 Years To Higher Man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the above understanding, the Bible accounts for only 2,488 years of the history of higher man and have little to do with the birth of the universe eons before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis understanding is actually quite logical when one considers that the purpose of creating the world had nothing to do with the Big Bang, the rise of lower species, the appearance of primates or primitive man; all of which were probably "ho hum" events when viewed against the backdrop of our infinitely Holy and Unfathomably Intelligent Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is confirmed by the statement that the purpose of creating higher man world was to create a holy dwelling place in the lower worlds; the lower worlds representing the balance of the world outside the boundaries of the Bible, and its associated immorality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Almighty, infinite and completely unbound by time, the billions of years prior to the Exodus, took no longer than the blink of a human eye. The billions of years during which the earth passed through eons of speciation have no significance to the Divine plan for the world and the universe. the only event of significance occurs in the last 7,000 years of world with the appearance of higher man and bestowal of free choice and higher reasoning does this mundane world, indeed this mundane universe, have the potential to be elevated to a new plane of holiness; a holiness that should be soon be revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only with the Exodus, and the many associated miracles manifest with Divine love as recounted in the deep involvement of the Almighty in Genesis, does the Bible truly begin. Further, the true revelation of holiness will only culminate in the Messianic era upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupernal Holiness, Then, and In the Future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis is a Divine perspective of how the vast power of the Almighty was lovingly concentrated in creating changes with the potential to elevate higher man, the Holy Land, the planet and the universe. Exodus  exquisitely records man''s perspective of the actual events that occur in preparation for receiving a new Moral framework for living in the Holy Land and throughout the world as a preparation to greeting the true and all encompassing Messianic Era, led by our righteous redeemer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the space allotted by a article, and Rabbinic interdiction, have curtailed a more in depth analysis of the Creation, it is hoped that this brief article will aid Jews and Gentiles in strengthening adherence to their respective Divine Codes and Obligations – the 613 Codes and the Noahite Guidelines, respectively – as presented in the Bible, the greatest moral and spiritual work of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Rashi Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, known as Rashi, February 22, 1040 – July 17, 1105, who wrote the first and foremost comprehensive commentary on the Hebrew Bible and Talmud.\r\n\r\n[ii] See Rashi Genesis 1:14\r\n\r\n[iii] This is not a reference to rain clouds and lightning. Lightning may be produced together with rain but lightning does not have the same source as rain, nor is it a blessing. For example, Deuteronomy 11:14  “when you will serve with all your heart, I (the Almighty) will provide the rain for your land in its time. There is no mention of lightning as a blessing.\r\n\r\n[iv] Exodus 14:5 See Rashi for accounting of the days of the Exodus\r\n\r\n[v] Genesis 1:14 Rashi caption “For days “\r\n\r\n[vi] Holiness is signified by a "v" prefix. See Rashi to Genesis 2:3, on the words “And He gave a Holy Blessing, And He gave a Holy Sanctification”. The “V” prefix clearly imparts additional holiness to these words, associating them with miracles related to the Exodus.\r\n\r\n[vii] Without any prefix of "v" or "h" on either the word "lights" or "let there be", the word "profane" has been added to emphasize the lack of holiness in this event.\r\n\r\n[viii] See Proverbs 3:9 where Rashi brings an interpretation from “Pesikta”.\r\n\r\n[ix] diphtheria “Askufah”, a disease of the throat that causes suffocation\r\n\r\n[x] Note that the caption to this Rashi is “yehi Moros”. Rashi goes on to state that the “V” is missing. While one could postulated that the missing “V” is in the word “Moros”, it is missing  from the word “yehi”, let there be.\r\n\r\n[xi] Exodus 15:23 Rashi: “marosah” is equivalent to “le morah”, and the “s” is equivalent to an “h”.\r\n\r\n[xii] Rashi on Psalm 105:8 based upon Talmud Chagigah\r\n\r\n[xiii] This figure is offered only to demonstrate a possible time frame for the Bible based upon observable events. During the first ten generations of the Bible, each generation is recorded as being many years longer.\r\n\r\n[xiv] Ten generations were born from Adam to Noah, ten generations from Noah to Abraham and six generations from Abraham to Moses[xiv], a total of 26 generations\r\n\r\n[xv] The word "oseh", “make” is used throughout the Holy Chariot and Creation Account as a reference to procreation.', 'Genesis and Time', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '271-revision-2', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:28:23', '2013-07-07 12:28:23', '', 271, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=274', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

Introduction \n\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\n\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\n\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\n\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \nsubject.\n\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\n\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \n2.1.1. Rome Convention \nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\n\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\n\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\n\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\n\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\n\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \n\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\n\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\n\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\n\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \n2.2.1. Council of Europe \nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\n\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\n\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\n\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\n\n2.2.2. European Union \nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\n\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\n\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\n\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\n\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\n\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\n\n3.1 Scope of Protection \nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\n\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\n\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\n\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\n\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\n\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\n\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\n\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\n\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \nbased on a broader notion.\n\n\n\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\n\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\n\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\n\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\n\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\n\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\n\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\n\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \n“webcasting” would not be needed.\n\n3.2 Substance of Protection \nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\n\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\n\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\n\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\n\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \nfor Information Law (IViR). \n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\nHtml/034.htm </a>\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\nHtml/153.htm</a> \n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

(278, 2, '2013-07-07 12:42:52', '2013-07-07 12:42:52', 'Universal Inheritable Barcodes for Identifying Organisms\r\nJonathan Gressel and Gal Ehrlich\r\nTrends in Plant Science 2002, 7:542-544\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe needs for recognition of novel conventional or transgenic organisms include protection of patented or Identity Preserved lines, detecting transgenics and tracing dispersal. We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

Here we report that the growth factors of Shope fibroma virus, Myxoma virus and vaccinia virus (SFGF, MGF and VGF) display unique patterns of specificity to ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases; whereas SFGF is a broad-specificity ligand, VGF binds primarily to ErbB-1 homodimers, and the exclusive receptor for MGF is a heterodimer comprised of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. In spite of 10- to 1000-fold lower binding affinity to their respective receptors, the viral ligands are mitogenically equivalent or even more potent than their mammalian counterparts. This remarkable enhancement of cell growth is due to attenuation of receptor degradation and ubiquitination, which leads to sustained signal transduction.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices.

E2020, marketed as Aricept®, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range.\r\n\r\nResults: Our experimental structure of the E2020–TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the ‘oxyanion hole’, but only indirectly via solvent molecules.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&searchtype=a">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&searchtype=a</a>', 'Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 ( Aricept ® ):', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '263-revision-2', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:20:38', '2013-07-07 12:20:38', '', 263, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=355', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Paradoxically, the neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 is devoid of catalytic activity, but its heterodimerization with other ErbBs, particularly the ligand-less ErbB-2 oncoprotein of carcinomas, reconstitutes superior mitogenic and transforming activities. To understand the underlying mechanism we constructed a chimeric EGF-receptor (ErbB-1) whose autophosphorylation C-terminal domain was replaced by the corresponding portion of ErbB-3. Consistent with the possibility that this domain recruits a relatively potent signaling pathway(s), the mitogenic signals generated by the recombinant fusion protein were superior to those generated by ErbB-1 homodimers and comparable to the proliferative activity of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, the chimeric receptor recruited an ErbB-3-specific repertoire of signaling proteins, including Shc and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but excluding the ErbB-1-specific substrate, phospholipase Cgamma1. Unlike ErbB-1, which is destined to lysosomal degradation through a mechanism that includes recruitment of c-Cbl and receptor poly-ubiquitination, the C-terminal tail of ErbB-3 shunted the chimeric protein to the ErbB-3-characteristic recycling pathway. These observations attribute the mitogenic superiority of ErbB-3 to its C-terminal tail and imply that the flanking kinase domain has lost catalytic activity in order to restrain the relatively potent signaling capability of the C-terminus.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf</a>\r\n', 'The C-terminus of the kinase-defective neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 confers mitogenic superiority and dictates endocytic routing.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '247-revision-3', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:12:57', '2013-07-07 12:12:57', '', 247, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=356', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\n\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\n\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\n\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\n\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\n\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\n\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\n\nFig. 1.\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\n\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\n\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\n\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\n\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\n\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\n\nRegulation\n\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\n\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

Unlike ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of ErbB-3 is catalytically impaired. By using interleukin-3-dependent cells that ectopically express the three ErbB proteins or their combinations, we found that ErbB-3 is devoid of any biological activity but both ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 can reconstitute its extremely potent mitogenic activity. Transactivation of ErbB-3 correlates with heterodimer formation and is reflected in receptor phosphorylation and the transregulation of ligand affinity. Inter-receptor interactions enable graded proliferative and survival signals: heterodimers are more potent than homodimers, and ErbB-3-containing complexes, especially the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer, are more active than ErbB-1 complexes. Nevertheless, ErbB-1 signaling displays dominance over ErbB-3 when the two receptors are coexpressed. Although all receptor combinations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and c-Jun kinase, they differ in their rate of endocytosis and in coupling to intervening signaling proteins. It is conceivable that combinatorial receptor interactions diversify signal transduction and confer double regulation, in cis and in trans, of the superior mitogenic activity of the kinase-defective ErbB-3.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf</a>', 'Diversification of Neu differentiation factor and epidermal growth factor signaling by combinatorial receptor interactions.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '260-revision-3', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:39:26', '2013-07-07 13:39:26', '', 260, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=403', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2. The observed superior ability of ErbB-2 to form heterodimers, in conjunction with its uniquely high basal tyrosine kinase activity, may explain why ErbB-2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf</a>', 'A hierarchical network of interreceptor interactions determines signal transduction by Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin and epidermal growth factor.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '258-revision-15', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:37:15', '2013-07-07 13:37:15', '', 258, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=404', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We report that ligand-induced degradation of internalized ErbB-1, but not ErbB-3, is mediated by transient mobilization of a minor fraction of c-Cbl into ErbB-1-containing endosomes. This recruitment depends on the receptor’s tyrosine kinase activity and an intact carboxy-terminal region. The alternative fate is recycling of internalized ErbBs to the cell surface. Cbl-mediated receptor sorting involves covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules, and subsequent lysosomal and proteasomal degradation. The oncogenic viral form of Cbl inhibits down-regulation by shunting endocytosed receptors to the recycling pathway.

Paradoxically, the neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 is devoid of catalytic activity, but its heterodimerization with other ErbBs, particularly the ligand-less ErbB-2 oncoprotein of carcinomas, reconstitutes superior mitogenic and transforming activities. To understand the underlying mechanism we constructed a chimeric EGF-receptor (ErbB-1) whose autophosphorylation C-terminal domain was replaced by the corresponding portion of ErbB-3. Consistent with the possibility that this domain recruits a relatively potent signaling pathway(s), the mitogenic signals generated by the recombinant fusion protein were superior to those generated by ErbB-1 homodimers and comparable to the proliferative activity of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, the chimeric receptor recruited an ErbB-3-specific repertoire of signaling proteins, including Shc and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but excluding the ErbB-1-specific substrate, phospholipase Cgamma1. Unlike ErbB-1, which is destined to lysosomal degradation through a mechanism that includes recruitment of c-Cbl and receptor poly-ubiquitination, the C-terminal tail of ErbB-3 shunted the chimeric protein to the ErbB-3-characteristic recycling pathway. These observations attribute the mitogenic superiority of ErbB-3 to its C-terminal tail and imply that the flanking kinase domain has lost catalytic activity in order to restrain the relatively potent signaling capability of the C-terminus.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf</a>\r\n', 'The C-terminus of the kinase-defective neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 confers mitogenic superiority and dictates endocytic routing.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '247-revision-4', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:45:10', '2013-07-07 13:45:10', '', 247, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=407', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(456, 1, '2013-07-08 08:00:53', '2013-07-08 08:00:53', 'Universal Inheritable Barcodes for Identifying Organisms\r\nJonathan Gressel and Gal Ehrlich\r\nTrends in Plant Science 2002, 7:542-544\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe needs for recognition of novel conventional or transgenic organisms include protection of patented or Identity Preserved lines, detecting transgenics and tracing dispersal. We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

E2020, marketed as Aricept®, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range.\r\n\r\nResults: Our experimental structure of the E2020–TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the ‘oxyanion hole’, but only indirectly via solvent molecules.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link:\r\n<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&amp;searchtype=a">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&amp;searchtype=a</a>', 'Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 ( Aricept ® ):', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '263-revision-5', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:08', '2013-07-08 08:02:08', '', 263, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=460', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Unlike ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of ErbB-3 is catalytically impaired. By using interleukin-3-dependent cells that ectopically express the three ErbB proteins or their combinations, we found that ErbB-3 is devoid of any biological activity but both ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 can reconstitute its extremely potent mitogenic activity. Transactivation of ErbB-3 correlates with heterodimer formation and is reflected in receptor phosphorylation and the transregulation of ligand affinity. Inter-receptor interactions enable graded proliferative and survival signals: heterodimers are more potent than homodimers, and ErbB-3-containing complexes, especially the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer, are more active than ErbB-1 complexes. Nevertheless, ErbB-1 signaling displays dominance over ErbB-3 when the two receptors are coexpressed. Although all receptor combinations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and c-Jun kinase, they differ in their rate of endocytosis and in coupling to intervening signaling proteins. It is conceivable that combinatorial receptor interactions diversify signal transduction and confer double regulation, in cis and in trans, of the superior mitogenic activity of the kinase-defective ErbB-3.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf</a>', 'Diversification of Neu differentiation factor and epidermal growth factor signaling by combinatorial receptor interactions.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '260-revision-4', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:35', '2013-07-08 08:02:35', '', 260, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=461', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2. The observed superior ability of ErbB-2 to form heterodimers, in conjunction with its uniquely high basal tyrosine kinase activity, may explain why ErbB-2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf</a>', 'A hierarchical network of interreceptor interactions determines signal transduction by Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin and epidermal growth factor.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '258-revision-16', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:54', '2013-07-08 08:02:54', '', 258, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=462', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, some ligands are more potent than others, although they bind to the same direct receptor. In addition, signaling by receptor heterodimers is superior to homodimers. We addressed the mechanism underlying these two features of signal tuning by using three ligands: EGF; transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha); and their chimera, denoted E4T, which act on cells singly expressing ErbB-1 as a weak, a strong, and a very strong agonist, respectively. Co-expression of ErbB-2, a developmentally important co-receptor whose expression is frequently elevated in human cancers, specifically potentiated EGF signaling to the level achieved by TGFalpha, an effect that was partially mimicked by ErbB-3. Analysis of the mechanism underlying this trans-potentiation implied that EGF-driven homodimers of ErbB-1 are destined for intracellular degradation, whereas the corresponding heterodimers with ErbB-2 or with ErbB-3, dissociate in the early endosome. As a consequence, in the presence of either co-receptor, ErbB-1 is recycled to the cell surface and its signaling is enhanced. This latter route is followed by TGFalpha-driven homodimers of ErbB-1, and also by E4T-bound receptors, whose signaling is further enhanced by repeated cycles of binding and dissociation from the receptors. We conclude that alternative endocytic routes of homo- and hetero-dimeric receptor complexes may contribute to tuning and diversification of signal transduction. In addition, the ability of ErbB-2 to shunt ligand-activated receptors to recycling may explain, in part, its oncogenic\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf</a>\r\n', 'Differential endocytic routing of homo- and hetero-dimeric ErbB tyrosine kinases confers signaling superiority to receptor heterodimers.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '256-revision-5', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:39:02', '2013-07-07 13:39:02', '', 256, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=463', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

בינתיים ללא מענה ברור, בהקשר של תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nדינן של תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n"לעולם לא נוכל להציב שלט המכריז ''סלילת הדרך הושלמה'' כי המדע ימשיך להתפתח... התהליך יהיה דינמי... ואף פעם לא יסתיים", דברי גב'' מרגרט המבורג, נציבת ה-FDA האמריקאי, על החקיקה החדשה בעניין תרופות ביולוגיות עקבות, נובמבר 2010.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nתחום חדש זה, שטרם זכה להגדרה רשמית בשפה העברית, מושך תשומת לב רבה בעיתונות הפופולארית, בתעשיית הביוטכנולוגיה, בחוגי הקניין הרוחני, בשווקים הפיננסיים ובבתי המחוקקים בכל העולם, והוא הולך ומתפתח. בטור זה ננסה להגדיר תרופות ביולוגית עוקבות (Follow-on Biologics) הנקראות גם תרופות ביולוגיות דומות (Biosimilar) ולעמוד על פשר הסערה סביבן.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nתרופות ביולוגיות – החול בשעון אוזל\r\n\r\nתרופה ביולוגית היא תרופה ממקור ביולוגי המיוצרת באמצעות ביוטכנולוגיה. על פי רוב היא מיוצרת מתאים או מיצורים חיים, או ממרכיביהם הפעילים ביולוגית: חלבונים וחומצות נוקלאיות רקומביננטיים, נוגדנים מונוקלונליים, תרכיבים לחיסון, מרכיבי דם, חלבונים לא רקומביננטיים מתרבית, תאים בתרבית, וקטורים וירליים רקומביננטיים ורקמות. תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות הן תרופות ביולוגיות "גנריות". רשמית הן אינן מוגדרות גנריות כיוון שאינן זהות לחלוטין לתרופת המקור.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nחלק מהתרופות הביולוגיות מוכרות לנו היטב, כמו למשל כמה תרופות מקבוצת הנוגדנים המונוקלונליים, כדוגמת אנברל (Enbrel, etanercept), הרספטין (Herceptin, trastuzumab) ואווסטין (Avastin, bevacizumab) או פקטורי גידול כמו ניולסטה (Neulasta, pegfilgrastim), והרשימה עוד ארוכה. גילוין ואישורן לשימוש קליני חדשים יחסית, ולכן רובן עדיין מוגנות על ידי הפטנטים המקוריים. אולם תוקף פטנט מוגבל הוא, ובקרוב יפוג תוקף פטנטים של תרופות ביולוגיות רבות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nבניגוד לתהליכי הסינתזה הכימית של מולקולות קטנות, ייצור תרופות ביולוגיות נעשה בתאים וביצורים חיים, ודורש השקעת משאבים גדולה, בשל מורכבותן הרבה. לכן פיתוח, רגולציה, קבלת פטנט, ייצור ובקרת איכות של תרופה ביולוגית מורכבים יותר, ממושכים יותר, ועלותם גבוהה יותר, לפעמים פי 20 ויותר. עלות תרופה ביולוגיות נעה סביב 16,000$ בשנה בממוצע, אך היא יכולה להגיע להרבה יותר: הרספטין לסרטן השד עולה כ-50,000$ בשנה, סרזיים\r\n\r\n(Cerezyme, imiglucerase) למחלת גושה עולה כ-200,000$ בשנה, ואילו טיפול בבקסאר ובזוולין (tositumomab Bexxar, ו-Zevalin, ibritumomab) לסרטן הדם יכול להגיע ל-25-30,000$ בחודש.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nעד 2018 הרספטין ואווסטין, המשמשות טיפול בסרטן השד, ואנברל, המשמש טיפול במחלות אוטואימוניות, יאבדו את הגנת הפטנטים. ההכנסות משלוש התרופות הללו בלבד נאמדות בכ-20 מיליארד דולר בשנה. באותו הזמן צפויה פקיעתם של פטנטים נוספים של תרופות ביולוגיות ששווין כ-59 מיליארד דולר בשנה. הערכות קובעות שכניסתן של תרופות עוקבות לשוק תחסוך בין 20%\r\n\r\nל-40% ממחיר התרופה למטופל, והן יעמידו את החיסכון העתידי על 300 מיליארד דולר ויותר, עד 2029 בארה"ב בלבד.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nלכן העניין הרב בתרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות, והצורך להגדיר בחוק תנאים שבהם יוכלו מתחרים גנריים לייצר ולשווק את התרופות הביולוגיות, בפקיעת תקופת הבלעדיות שלהן. יצרנים גנריים דוגלים בחשיפת מידע על פיתוח וייצור התרופה הראשונית, קיצור תקופת הבלעדיות עליהן, צמצום דרישות הרגולציה על תרופה עוקבת וצמצום האפשרות להגנה על שיפורים ושינויים בתרופה המקורית. לעומתם, היצרנים המקוריים (אינובטיביים) שואפים לבלעדיות ממושכת על הפטנטים ועל המידע, לרגולציה נוקשה על תרופות עוקבות, ולהגנה רחבה על שינויים בתרופה המקורית. הטיפול בנושא שונה ממדינה למדינה, ומשקף, בין השאר, את מצבם של המחקר ושל תעשיות הביוטכנולוגיה במדינות השונות ואת המסורות השונות במתן שירותי בריאות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nמצא את ההבדלים\r\n\r\nכבר ב-2005 הגה ופרסם ארגון הרפואה האירופאי, ה-EMEA, הנחיות לרגולציה של תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות, הכוללות הנחיות כלליות, חלוקה של התרופות הביולוגיות לקבוצות ולתת-קבוצות וקני מידה ייחודיים ומפורטים לבחינת אישורן של תרופות בכל קבוצה. אילו ארה"ב חוקקה במרץ 2010 את ה-BPCIA, חוק לעידוד תחרות מחירים ופיתוח בתרופות ביולוגיות, הצעד הראשון בהסדרת אישור ושיווק תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות בארה"ב. הנחיות ה-EMEA אינן חופפות לחוק האמריקאי, וניכרים הבדלים אחדים ביניהם, וגם - הפתעה.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nהן ה-EMEA והן ה-FDA קובעים כי תרופה עוקבת חייבת להיות דומה עד דומה מאוד לתרופה הראשונית, מבחינת טיבה, בטיחותה ויעילותה. שניהם דורשים הוכחות לזהות בין התרופה העוקבת לראשונית במנגנון הפעולה, אם הוא ידוע, ברמת הניקיון, בתכונות הפיזיקו-כימיות כולל המבנה התלת-ממדי, הוכחת אי רעילות ומוטגניות בחיות, וניסויים קליניים לבחינת יעילות, אימונוגניות, פרמאקודינמיקה ופרמאקוקינטיקה. כמו כן אישור יינתן רק עבור אינדיקציות ודרכי שימוש שכבר אושרו לתרופה הראשונית.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nתקופת הבלעדיות על התרופה הראשונית חשובה מאוד ליצרנים. בארה"ב אישור לתרופה עוקבת לא יינתן עד חלוף 12 שנים מאישור התרופה הראשונית, ואילו באירופה אישור לתרופה עוקבת לא יינתן עד חלוף 10 שנים, עם אפשרות לשנה נוספת בגין אישור על אינדיקציה חדשה. יצרנים גנריים מרבים לקרוא תיגר על תוקפם המשפטי של פטנטים המגנים על התרופה הראשונית. באירופה, יצרן המבקש אישור על תרופה עוקבת אינו מחויב בהצהרת כוונות לבעלי הפטנט של התרופה הראשונית, על אף שלעתים הוא מתבקש לספק מידע מסוים לבעלי הפטנט כדי ללבן סוגיות קניין רוחני ולמנוע צווי מניעה נגדו בגין הפרה. בארה"ב, לעומת זאת, המבקש אישור לתרופה עוקבת חייב להעביר לבעל הפטנט הודעה על כך כולל תוכן בקשת האישור. בעל הפטנט יכול אז להודיע על הפרת פטנטים משוערת, בציון הפטנטים הבעיתיים. בתגובה, יצרני התרופה העוקבת יכולים להגיש הסבר לאי הפרה, בדרך כלל על ידי ניסיון לשלול את התוקף המשפטי של הפטנט, או על ידי הצהרה שאין בכוונתם לייצר ולשווק את התרופה העוקבת עד פקיעת תוקף הפטנט על התרופה הראשונית. בעל הפטנט מגיש טענות והסברים מפורטים לכל אחת מטענות המבקש. אם משא ומתן בין הצדדים לא מוביל להסכמה, רק אז יכול בעל הפטנט להגיש תביעת הפרה נגד יצרן התרופה העוקבת. תהליך זה יכול לארוך 300-200 ימים, זמן שוק יקר למבקש אישור לתרופה עוקבת. מה עוד- העדר "ספר כתום",(orange book) לתרופות ביולוגיות המאגד את כל המידע על תרופות מאושרות, כולל פטנטים רלוונטים, תחליפים גנריים ועדכונים קליניים, גורם להתנהלות מול יצרן תרופה ביולוגית ראשונית להיות מורכבת, יקרה וממושכת.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nההפתעה הגדולה באה מתוך ההגדרות של תרופה ביולוגית עוקבת בחוק ה-BPCIA האמריקאי: החוק יצר קטגוריה נפרדת לתרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות "חלופיות" (interchangeable). לפי החוק, ספק או רוקח יכולים לספק את התרופות הללו במקום את התרופות המקוריות ללא הוראה מפורשת של רופא. אך יש גם קאץ'': ההגדרה של תרופה עוקבת "חלופית" היא תרופה הזהה לתרופה הביולוגית המקורית ביעילות ובבטיחות, בקונטקסט הקליני. בשל הקושי בעמידה בקנה מידה נוקשה זה, רבים רואים בו מכשול שיאלץ יצרנים להשקיע רבות בשיווק של התרופות הביולוגיות העוקבות לרופאים, הנותנים מרשמים למטופלים, ויעכב את כניסתן הרחבה לשימוש. להפרדה של החוק האמריקאי בין "דומה" (biosimilar) לבין "חלופי" (interchangeable) אין מקבילה בהנחיות ה-EMEA האירופאיות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nהשאלה כמה "דומה" זה מספיק לשימוש קליני של תרופה ביולוגית מורכבת, נשארת בינתיים ללא מענה ברור, בהקשר של תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות. המבנים המורכבים אינם קלים להגדרה, הדורשת כלים מתוחכמים ויקרים יותר מאשר בתרופות של מולקולות קטנות. יתרה מזאת, לחלבונים יש תכונות ייחודיות קריטיות לפעולתם, כמו גליקוזילציה וסידור במרחב, שכל שינוי בהן גורר בהכרח שינוי ביעילות פעולתה, בפרמאקוקינטיקה שלה או באימונוגניות שלה. חשוב להגדיר את התכונות האלה בקביעת דמיון התרופה העוקבת, אך בשל מורכבות המולקולות, קשה מאוד לעמוד על טיבן. בשל קשיים אלה, רבים מקווים שרשויות ה-EMEA, ה-FDA ומקבילותיהן במדינות אחרת יעשו מאמץ להגות הגדרות ומבחנים אחידים לקביעת הדמיון של תרופה עוקבת.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nנוסעים רחוק\r\n\r\nתחום התרופות הביולוגיות העוקבות מושך תשומת לב רבה גם במדינות מתפתחות בעלות תעשיית תרופות גנריות מפותחת כמו הודו, ברזיל ומדינות המזרח הרחוק. ככלל, חוקי רשויות התרופות במדינות מתפתחות מחמירים פחות, ונוטים להעדיף את התעשייה המקומית על חברות מערביות ורב-לאומיות. יצרנים גנריים ותיקים וגדולים כמו ד"ר רדיז לבס (Dr. Reddy''s Laboratories Ltd.), סיפלה ( Cipla Ltd.) ווקהרדט (Wockhardt Ltd.) ההודיות, שנדונג זינהואה (Shandong Xinhua) הסינית וסלטריון (Celltrion, Inc.) מדרום קוריאה כבר מייצרים בעצמם תרופות עוקבות. צפוי שיצרני התרופות הביולוגיות המערביות ואפילו הרשויות יערימו קשיים בפני יצרני התרופות העוקבות הזרות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nאחת הדרכים של יצרני התרופות במדינות מתפתחות להתגבר על המחסור בתשתיות טכניות ומקצועיות היא שיתוף פעולה עם יצרני תרופות מערביות. כך פתחו לאחרונה חברת ביוקון ההודית וחברת פייזר בשיתוף פעולה לייצור גרסאות עוקבות של אינסולין הומני רקומביננטי, תחילה להפצה בהודו, אך עם כוונה להפצה עתידית בארה"ב ובאירופה. בישראל לאחרונה הודיעה חברת טבע על שיתוף פעולה עם חברת לונזה (Lonza) השוויצרית, המתמחית בייצור תרופות ביולוגיות ותרופות מורכבות נוספות, לייצור תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות לשוק העולמי.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nאיום מסוים, שנוי במחלקת, הרובץ על יצרני תרופות ביולוגיות מערביים בשווקים מתפתחים הוא זיכיון בכוח. בחלק מהמדינות המתפתחות בעלות תעשיית תרופות משגשגת כמו תאילנד, ברזיל והודו, ישנו חוק המאפשר עקיפת פטנט תקף והענקת רישיון ייצור מקומי במקרי חירום. בהודו לאחרונה הורחב החוק למקרים שבהם מחיר התרופה מונע טיפול בה מקהל הנזקקים, ובתכנית לכלול גם רישיון ייצוא של תרופות המיוצרות תחת זיכיון בכוח למדינות נזקקות מחוסרות אמצעי ייצור תרופות מקומיים.תאילנד, ברזיל, הודו ועוד מדינות כבר העניקו זיכיונות בכוח לייצור תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות, אולם מומחים מעריכים כי תעשיות תרופות ביולוגיות במדינות מתפתחות לא יוכלו לצמוח, ולא יוכלו להשתתף בתחרות בשווקים בין-לאומיים מבלי להעמיד סטנדרטים רגולטוריים ואמצעי אכיפה להבטחת טוהרן, יעילותן ובטיחותן של התרופות.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nלסיכום, נראה שהמורכבות המדעית והטכנית הכרוכה בפיתוח, ייצור, אישור ויישום קליני של תרופות ביולוגיות מעמידה אתגרים קשים בהתוויית כללים לפיקוח על הגרסאות הגנריות שלהן, תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות. כל זאת, על רקע מאבקים בין חברות רב-לאומיות, וממשלות המערב, לבין תעשיות מדינות מתפתחות, וממשלותיהן, על השימוש הנבון במונופול המוענק בפטנט בכלכלה עולמית דינמית.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'שתי טיפות, ד"ר דוד מנצ''ר', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed',

וסידור במרחב, שכל שינוי בהן גורר בהכרח שינוי ביעילות פעולתה, בפרמאקוקינטיקה שלה או באימונוגניות שלה. חשוב להגדיר את התכונות האלה בקביעת דמיון התרופה העוקבת, אך בשל מורכבות המולקולות, קשה מאוד לעמוד על טיבן. בשל קשיים אלה, רבים מקווים שרשויות ה-EMEA, ה-FDA ומקבילותיהן במדינות אחרת יעשו מאמץ להגות הגדרות ומבחנים אחידים לקביעת הדמיון של תרופה עוקבת.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nנוסעים רחוק\n\nתחום התרופות הביולוגיות העוקבות מושך תשומת לב רבה גם במדינות מתפתחות בעלות תעשיית תרופות גנריות מפותחת כמו הודו, ברזיל ומדינות המזרח הרחוק. ככלל, חוקי רשויות התרופות במדינות מתפתחות מחמירים פחות, ונוטים להעדיף את התעשייה המקומית על חברות מערביות ורב-לאומיות. יצרנים גנריים ותיקים וגדולים כמו ד"ר רדיז לבס (Dr. Reddy''s Laboratories Ltd.), סיפלה ( Cipla Ltd.) ווקהרדט (Wockhardt Ltd.) ההודיות, שנדונג זינהואה (Shandong Xinhua) הסינית וסלטריון (Celltrion, Inc.) מדרום קוריאה כבר מייצרים בעצמם תרופות עוקבות. צפוי שיצרני התרופות הביולוגיות המערביות ואפילו הרשויות יערימו קשיים בפני יצרני התרופות העוקבות הזרות.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nאחת הדרכים של יצרני התרופות במדינות מתפתחות להתגבר על המחסור בתשתיות טכניות ומקצועיות היא שיתוף פעולה עם יצרני תרופות מערביות. כך פתחו לאחרונה חברת ביוקון ההודית וחברת פייזר בשיתוף פעולה לייצור גרסאות עוקבות של אינסולין הומני רקומביננטי, תחילה להפצה בהודו, אך עם כוונה להפצה עתידית בארה"ב ובאירופה. בישראל לאחרונה הודיעה חברת טבע על שיתוף פעולה עם חברת לונזה (Lonza) השוויצרית, המתמחית בייצור תרופות ביולוגיות ותרופות מורכבות נוספות, לייצור תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות לשוק העולמי.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nאיום מסוים, שנוי במחלקת, הרובץ על יצרני תרופות ביולוגיות מערביים בשווקים מתפתחים הוא זיכיון בכוח. בחלק מהמדינות המתפתחות בעלות תעשיית תרופות משגשגת כמו תאילנד, ברזיל והודו, ישנו חוק המאפשר עקיפת פטנט תקף והענקת רישיון ייצור מקומי במקרי חירום. בהודו לאחרונה הורחב החוק למקרים שבהם מחיר התרופה מונע טיפול בה מקהל הנזקקים, ובתכנית לכלול גם רישיון ייצוא של תרופות המיוצרות תחת זיכיון בכוח למדינות נזקקות מחוסרות אמצעי ייצור תרופות מקומיים.תאילנד, ברזיל, הודו ועוד מדינות כבר העניקו זיכיונות בכוח לייצור תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות, אולם מומחים מעריכים כי תעשיות תרופות ביולוגיות במדינות מתפתחות לא יוכלו לצמוח, ולא יוכלו להשתתף בתחרות בשווקים בין-לאומיים מבלי להעמיד סטנדרטים רגולטוריים ואמצעי אכיפה להבטחת טוהרן, יעילותן ובטיחותן של התרופות.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nלסיכום, נראה שהמורכבות המדעית והטכנית הכרוכה בפיתוח, ייצור, אישור ויישום קליני של תרופות ביולוגיות מעמידה אתגרים קשים בהתוויית כללים לפיקוח על הגרסאות הגנריות שלהן, תרופות ביולוגיות עוקבות. כל זאת, על רקע מאבקים בין חברות רב-לאומיות, וממשלות המערב, לבין תעשיות מדינות מתפתחות, וממשלותיהן, על השימוש הנבון במונופול המוענק בפטנט בכלכלה עולמית דינמית.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', '', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '665-revision', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:33:46', '2013-10-16 11:33:46', '', 665, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=666', 0,

Since the latter part of 2010, USPTO policy is to no longer prioritize RCE applications, and thus most RCE filings have not received an action since such a filing. The Prioritized program addresses this problem for those applicants willing to pay the fees involved. Only one RCE may be eligible for the program per application.\r\n\r\n4. The application must be complete when filed, including the executed Declaration and fees.\r\n\r\n5. The request for prioritized examination must be made at the time of filing the application, though in the case of an RCE, the request may be made anytime before a first action is issued on an RCE. Pending applications, other than RCE''s, are thus not eligible to be accepted in the program.\r\n\r\n6. The number of claims is limited to thirty, of which no more than four can be independent. Multiple dependent claims are not permitted.\r\n\r\n7.

Any U.S. patent application filed after March 15, 2013 will be subject to the new provisions of the law that now provides that the "first to file" a patent application for an invention will be entitled to the patent, rather than the "first to invent".\r\n\r\nOther than publications of the inventor within a one year grace period prior to the filing of the patent application, prior art or acts having a date earlier than the effective filing date of the patent application will be available as prior art.\r\n\r\n<strong>New Fee Schedule</strong>\r\n\r\nEffective March 19, 2013, the USPTO is instituting a new fee schedule with (surprise) mainly increased fees, mostly minor. An example of an increased fee is the first month extension to response fee increases from $75 to $100 for Small Entities. Maintenance Fees are also increasing appreciably, anywhere from $225 for the Maintenance Fee due at the 3.5 year mark, to $1,295 due at the 11.5 year mark. For all those whose window to pay the Maintenance Fee has opened up before March 19, 2013, and who have already decided to pay the Maintenance Fee, should consider paying the fee before then rather than waiting to pay the higher fee at a later date.\r\n\r\n<strong>Prioritized Examination (Including RCE''s)</strong>\r\n\r\nAs discussed in an earlier Ehrlich &amp; Fenster Newsletter (No. 22, February 2012), prioritized examination to obtain a prompt (within a year) decision of patentability is available for the first 10,000 applicants per fiscal year, to those willing to pay an additional $2,400 (small entity) if a request is made at the time of filing the patent application. This option is also available for Requests for Continued Examinations (RCE) (no need to file the prioritization request at the time of filing the RCE). We have noted that many examiners are not taking up RCE''s promptly and are following USPTO guidelines that went into effect in September 2010 that no longer prioritizes RCE''s. We have recently encountered a situation that an RCE filed in October 2010 will not be acted on for at least another two years! For those finding themselves in a similar situation and wishing to receive an action on their RCE promptly, should consider this option. Note that the USPTO is (shockingly) reducing their fee for Small Entity prioritized examination to $2,000 effective March 19, 2013.\r\n\r\n<strong>Micro Entity Status</strong>\r\n\r\nEffective March 19, 2013, the USPTO is instituting a new category of paying entity. All Small Entities who further certify that they meet the following below requirements, will be entitled to pay one-half of the Small Entity Fees:\r\n\r\n1. Neither the applicant nor any inventor have been named on more than four previously filed U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and that the applicant has an annual gross income not exceeding a certain level (currently approximately $150,200); or\r\n\r\n2.

(672, 2, '2013-01-01 11:37:34', '2013-01-01 11:37:34', 'The America Invents Act (AIA), signed into law in September 2011, amended the rules of practice in patent cases to implement the “first-inventor-to-file” provision. The first-inventor-to-file provision, which takes effect March 16, 2013, converts the United States patent system from a “first to invent” system to a first inventor to file system. Under current law, assuming there are no other statutory bars, if a first inventor is diligently working on reducing his invention to practice and thereafter files a patent application, but a second later inventor files a patent application before the first inventor files, the first inventor can “swear behind” the second inventor to show his earlier date of invention, and therefore obtain priority and U.S. patent rights to the invention. The new law changes this scheme such that that instead of measuring the priority of an invention based on its date of invention, priority will now be measured based on the date the first inventor actually files a patent application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).This change will also fundamentally alter the role of public “disclosures” in preserving the patentability of an invention. Meaning, the new law, found in new Section 102(a)(1), greatly expands the definition of prior art, making a person entitled to a patent unless “the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention…”\r\n\r\nThe first-to-file provision of the AIA reduces the attractiveness of provisional patent applications for Non-American inventors who can now file their priority patent applications in patent offices which provide an accelerated search without losing any rights in the USA. Examples for such patent offices include England, Italy, Luxemburg and Israel. The accelerated search enables applicants to receive information regarding the patentability of their invention(s) and possibility to amend the claims in their patent application accordigly, before the next stages (PCT filing and/or Paris convention filing).\r\n\r\nIsrael Search Authority\r\n\r\nThe Israel Patent Office in its announcement of November 2010, declared that an accelerated search report will be provided for a patent application first filed by inventor(s) which intend to later claim a priority date based on the patent application, for example when filing Paris/PCT Convention patent applications. Such patent applications will be examined within a period of about 3 months, so as to allow the inventor to receive a better understanding of the prior art prior of filing the patent application in other countries. As mentioned, the accelerated examination and search results will be beneficial to future decision making regarding the patent next stages. Filing such a request must be accompanied by paying an official fee of about 700 USD and submitting a declaration (signed affidavit) stating the inventor intend to claim priority from the patent application.\r\n\r\nEuropean Search Authority\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, a priority patent application may be filed in a number of European countries, which guarantee receiving a European Search Report within 10-12 month, for example England, Italy or Luxemburg. In such case, the specification and the claims may be amended based on the European Search Report to overcome the raised objections and cited prior art within 12 months from filing. It should be noted, that the filed application must be fully and accurately drafted as the EPO does not allow filing patent applications for search purposes only. In particular, the EPO has introduced some sweeping changes to the European Patent Convention (EPC) that impose serious restrictions on the prosecution of European patent applications. For example, an accelerated search is possible only if the application documents on filing are complete enough for the search report to be drawn up. In addtiion, the changes to the EPC also restrict subject matter that will be searched by the EPO during the initial phases of the prosecution of a European patent application. In particular, the EPO has imposed the following procedural restrictions on searches: only a single independent claim is allowed in each claim category; an incomplete search will be performed if the claims are deemed too broad or unclear; and a partial search will be performed if the claims are deemed to lack unity. Generally, subject matter, which has not been searched, will not be examined.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are still benefits in filing a US Provisional Patent Application as a priority document. First, the Provisional Patent Application provides a lower initial filing cost. Second, Provisional Applications are not subjected to the USPTO examination, only after a complete application has been filed will examination be initiated. As a result, the inventor benefits from one full year to assess the invention’s commercial potential before committing to the higher cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications worldwide.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Accelerated Search', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'accelerated-search', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:38:04', '2013-10-16 11:38:04', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=672', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The ability to upload and extract the uploaded data from different locations and the ability to easily merge various sources of information, makes cloud storage a logical storage facility for backup and archival data . The relatively low fees charged by the cloud storage facilities provides a great incentive to use their facilities rather than purchasing expensive additional in-house storage devices.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, commercial cloud storage does not always make a suitable storage solution for confidential information, especially proprietary R&amp;D data. Recently, cloud service customers were shocked to learn that their data was available for viewing by others, thereby jeopardizing their trade secrets and intellectual property that had not yet been protected by the filing of a patent application thereon, and which now may be barred from patent registration as a result of the public availability of the data.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors should be considered before storing proprietary R&amp;D data in commercial cloud platform providers:\r\n\r\n• Public disclosure: Unintended public disclosure of confidential information stored in commercial cloud storage facilities became more prevalent. Such disclosure may result in the loss of current and future intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n• Privacy - cloud service users should not assume that uploaded proprietary R&amp;D data that includes sensitive information is stored in a secure environment that meets their proclaimed privacy policy. If the cloud service user specified that data be used for one purpose, that assurance should be upheld by the cloud provider.\r\n\r\n• Secondary use of data – most cloud providers have full access to their clients’ data. Full access may sometimes result in the data being mined by the cloud provider or others. Some cloud storage service providers also claim usage rights on any uploaded data, such as pictures and presentations, which may result in public disclosure of the data.\r\n\r\n• Jurisdiction- In case of breach of confidentiality, users should ensure that any services deployed to the cloud are used according to laws and regulations that pertain in their location. So as to ensure specific laws and regulations are followed, the primary location of the data and any backup locations should be known.\r\n\r\nTips to avoid unintended public disclosure of confidential information:\r\n\r\n1. Consider the nature of the information when saving data onto a cloud platform. For example, confidential information of research participants that may result in breach of privacy. As the physical location of the servers is unknown in many cases, caution is required if any of the information stored is subject to any restrictions. Such restrictions may be on publication (prior approval or prior review), or imposed by non-disclosure agreements.\r\n\r\n2. Contract: Cloud service users should check their contract with the cloud provider before agreeing to the terms. The contract should contain a clause that states the cloud service user exclusively owns his own data and therefore will still have the ability to access the data and transfer it should the cloud provider go bankrupt or the contract terminated. The user should be able to include such a provision in the contract and not accept boiler plate provisions of the cloud service provider, if this aspect is critical.\r\n\r\n3. Security measures: The cloud service users should ensure the cloud provider has adequate security measures, including primary and backup locations. The cloud provide controls and procedures should also comply with the local laws of the region where the server is located.. Make sure the provider is in compliance with international standards, such as SSAE16 and SOC2, that determine the security, availability, process integrity, privacy, and confidentially of a data server.\r\n\r\n4. Back-ups: Cloud service users should not only rely on the cloud provider back-ups and ensure regular data backups of their own. Such back-ups are extremely important in case the cloud provider goes out of business, or the datacenter become inoperable.\r\n\r\n5. Secure the data: The user could consider adding another layer of security by encrypting the data residing in the cloud.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Protecting Intellectual Property In Cloud Storage', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'protecting-intellectual-property-in-cloud-storage', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:40:24', '2013-10-16 11:40:24', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=678', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The Supreme Court decided that there can be no liability for misuse of confidential information unless and until that information has been acquired, together with reasonable knowledge of its confidentiality.\r\n\r\nThis case involves an ex-employee and a former consultant of Vestergaard that decided to set up a rival company. The ex-employee, Mrs. Sig, had an employment contract forbidding her to use confidential information of Vestergaard even after she left her employment there. Dr Skovmand, the former consultant, had no such contract but obtained the confidential information from Vestergaard. Dr Skovmannd used the confidential information to make a competing product, but there was no evidence that Mrs. Sig knew that he had obtained the information from Vestergaard in breach of confidence.\r\n\r\nVestergaard''s main complaint was that the Respondents'' product was developed using their confidential information. Vestergaard’s appeal is against the Court of Appeal’s reversal of a decision by Arnold J that Mrs. Trine Sig, their ex-employee, was liable for misuse of their trade secrets after she ceased her employment with them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVestergaard’s contention that Mrs. Sig is liable for breach of confidence was based on: her employment contract; secondly, on the basis that she was party to a common design which involved Vestergaard’s trade secrets being misused; thirdly, for being party to the breach of confidence. The Supreme Court found that each of these three arguments must fail. Mrs. Sig did not herself ever acquire the confidential information in question, whether during the time of her employment with Vestergaard or afterwards. Also, until some point during the currency of the proceedings, Mrs. Sig was unaware that the product had been developed using Vestergaard’s trade secrets. Meaning, Mrs. Sig, was not liable for breach of confidence as she did not know, and there was no reason why she ought to have known, that what she was doing amounted to misuse of confidential information.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs for Vestergaard claim that Mrs. Sig had "blind-eye knowledge" of the use of the trade secrets, the court found that since there was no evidence that Mrs. Sig had been dishonest, merely taking a risk was not sufficient to establish secondary liability. Vestergaard''s main argument was that Mrs. Sig was liable on the basis of common design was also rejected as Mrs. Sig lacked the necessary knowledge.

As for the claim for Contractual liability, the terms of the contract were of no assistance. The court found that Mrs. Sig neither knew the trade secrets nor that they were being misused, which is inconsistent with the contract''s express terms; therefore there could be no liability.\r\n\r\nThe protection of intellectual property, including trade secrets, is one of the vital contributions of the law to research and development in the commercial world. Nevertheless, the law and should not discourage attempts to competition made by former employees by imposing unfair potential difficulties. If the UK Supreme Court''s decision was any different, it would have amounted to imposing strict liability for breach of confidence. Unlike patent infringement, which is a strict liability tort, so that an employer would be able to take action against a former employee for misusing trade secrets, where there is no express contractual term, there must be an ability to show dishonesty or at least knowledge that the information in dispute is confidential.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Ex-employees Liability for Trade Secrets', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'ex-employees-liability-for-trade-secrets', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:41:40', '2013-10-16 11:41:40', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=680', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In most countries, public disclosure of the invention by any person, including the patent applicant, before the filing of a patent application destroys novelty and the ability to obtain a valid patent. These countries are said to operate an "absolute novelty" requirement. Examples of acts that can make an invention available to the public are written or electronic publications, sales, public oral disclosures and public demonstrations or use.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore very important to file your patent application before it is disclosed or published somewhere. But what if the invention has been published before you had an opportunity to file a patent application thereon? Is it in the public domain, or can the inventor still have one last chance to file for a patent?\r\n\r\nIn some countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, a grace period exists for protecting an inventor or successor in title from authorized or unauthorized disclosure of the invention before the filing date. That is, if the inventor or the successor in title publishes the invention, an application can still be validly filed which will be considered novel despite the publication, provided that the filing is made during the grace period following the publication. The grace period is usually 6 or 12 months.\r\n\r\nSome absolute novelty countries provide a limited grace period for certain disclosures, which are limited to very limited circumstances. Examples of such circumstances include unauthorized disclosures by third parties who derive the invention from the applicant or presentations by the applicant before officially recognized academic societies. These limited grace periods typically provide for several months for the applicant to file a patent application, and require the applicant to inform the respective patent office about the earlier publication at the time of filing of the patent application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCountries that have a twelve month grace period include, inter alia, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Korea, Brazil, Australia, Argentina and the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRussia is an example of a country that has a six month grace period.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCountries that have a limited grace period (typically six month grace period) include, inter alia, Europe (includes Germany, France, U.K, Italy, Spain), China, Japan, Israel, Taiwan and India.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe above information should not be taken as legal advice.

(684, 2, '2013-04-16 11:47:25', '2013-04-16 11:47:25', 'On April 1, 2013, India’s Supreme Court rejected Novartis’ Patent Application for the cancer medication- Gleevec (spelled Glivec in India). This high-profile case, not only ended Novartis’ seven-year battle in India, but also represented a bigger battle over generic drugs both overseas and in the U.S. The Novartis case, has divided once more health activists who claims excessive pharmaceutical patenting stifles generic competition that makes life-saving medication accessible to patients around the world; and defenders of intellectual property rights demanding India protect patented medication.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, as a requirement of admission into the WTO, India reenacted patent protections for intellectual property. Until that change in India Patent Law, Indian pharmaceutical companies produced freely medicines pioneered by foreign drug companies at a fraction of the cost. Nevertheless, the Indian patent office stated earlier this year that generic manufacturers are entitled to make their own versions of a patented medication and pay a royalty to the patent holder, given the patented medication is not made available at a reasonable price in the Indian marketplace.\r\n\r\nNovartis Gleevec’s U.S. patent expires in 2015, meaning that other generic-drug manufacturers will be joining the Indians soon enough in their ability to produce Novartis’ medication. Anticipating this, Novartis has already engaged in “evergreening”, by which pharmaceutical companies introduce new drugs that are just slightly modified formulations of older drugs in order to effectively maintain patent protection. India’s Supreme Court rejected Novartis’ “evergreening”, on the basis that the formulation was not significantly different or better than previous drugs on the market. Meaning that, the modification made by Novartis did not satisfy the standard of inventiveness required under Indian patent law. As a result, Indian pharmaceuticals may continue producing generically Novartis’ medication and sell it in India at a fraction of the Swiss drug’s cost. Novartis claimed that there was a misconception suggesting Gleevec is an incremental improvement or “evergreening” rather than a novel drug. Per Novartis, This confusion was based on a patent for the synthesis of the molecule of imatinib, that was granted in 1993. However, this molecule represented only the first step in the process to develop Gleevec as a viable treatment for cancer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSecondary patents such as Novartis’, add, on average, between six and seven years to the patent life of the original compound. Some claim, that India’s Supreme Court decision may prevent such filings for minor innovations, at the expense of breakthrough innovation. On the other hand, Novartis and companies alike claim the decision discourages innovative drug discovery. One of the primary concerns of this case, was with India’s growing non-recognition of intellectual property rights that sustain research and development for innovative medicines and may have repercussions on India’s attempts to attract foreign investment.\r\n\r\nIn its 2013 Special 301 Report, the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) critiqued the ruling by India’s Supreme Court in the Novartis case. One result, was the USTR decision to retain India on its “Priority Watch List” for the present year. That decision, was based on India’s limited progress in improving its Intellectual Property Regime and enforcement system. The USTR also expressed concerns regarding the effect of limiting the patentability of potentially beneficial innovations. Such claims were also made by the WTO, and have led to a lot of protest by pharmaceutical companies.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Novartis decision, India had begun compelling pharmaceutical companies to issue licenses to domestic generic companies to make their patented drugs. Now, the Supreme Court’s decision will set an important precedent, which may change foreign drug companies’ perception of India. In the short term, patents may not guarantee foreign drug companies profit. Nonetheless, without patents, or with weak ones, no new and innovative medicines for untreated diseases would be developed and there would be no new generics, in India and other developing countries. Meaning that, later on the cost of lost investment will begin to outweigh the public health advantages.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The Novartis Decision: “Evergreening” and the future of Generics ', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-novartis-decision-evergreening-and-the-future-of-generics', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:48:01', '2013-10-16 11:48:01', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=684', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The Applicant, in response to this Communication is required to provide the examiner with results of all Search Reports conducted and/or references cited in corresponding applications and copies of all prior art relating to the obviousness and novelty of the application. The correction to the law now allows a third party to submit to the examiner prior art related to an application.

Filing such a request must be accompanied by paying an official fee and a submitting a Declaration stating the justifiable reason/s for expediting the examination. The Declaration must be detailed and well based. The correction to the law established the main grounds which may be considered justifiable reasons for requesting expedited examination. The reasons are as follows: (1) medical condition or advanced age of the applicant, (2) notification from the Patent Registrar of the possibility of early examination in view of a parallel application being examined in conditions and in countries set out by the Registrar, (3) infringement or an established concern of infringement about to occur, (4) unreasonable delay of the examination of application, (5) examination is in the public’s interest, and (6) special circumstances which would justify expedited examination.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe field of the invention bears no significance to the justification of reason for filing such a request.

(690, 2, '2011-09-01 11:50:04', '2011-09-01 11:50:04', 'A recent decision rendered by the Tel-Aviv District Court related to patent ownership held that the burden of proof is on the employer to demonstrate that the invention is a "service invention" and thus belonging under the law to the employer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe court also stated that an oral agreement between the employer and employee is sufficient to release the employee from providing notice of the invention under Section 131 of the Patents Law.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to Section 132 of the Patents Law, an invention by an employee arrived at in consequence of his service and during the period of his service shall, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary between him and his employer, become the employer’s property, unless the employer relinquishes the invention within six months after the day on which notification under Section 131 was delivered to him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFacts\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOrian Ltd. (www.orian.com) is an Israeli public company specialized in Air &amp; Ocean freight forwarding and logistics services. Ms. Yael Bonneh started working at Orian in 2006 as a project manager. In 2008 during her employment at Orian, Yael developed an invention, involving the use of thermal insulation sheets for transportation of goods, which allows keeping the temperature and humidity of the goods without an external energy source. In order to protect the invention, Yael filed in her own name a provisional patent application titled BREATHABLE INSULATION DEVICE. A year after, while still working for Orian, Yael filed a PCT application, also in her name, claiming priority from her US provisional application. Subsequent to the filing of the PCT application in Yael''s name, the parties disagreed about the ownership of the invention. Orian asked Yael to assign the entire rights of the invention to Orian – Yael argued that this is not what was agreed beforehand, she refused to sign the assignment and resigned from Orian. Soon thereafter, Orian filed a lawsuit against Yael requesting that the patent invention be transferred from Yael to Orian.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDecision\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOrian argued that Yael was employed at Orian and therefore the invention was a service invention belonging under the law to the employer (Section 132 of the Patents Law). Orian also argued that no agreement existed between the parties with respect to the ownership of the patent. Orian further argued that all the filing costs of the PCT application were paid by Orian and therefore it is illogic to conclude that Yael will own the applications. Orian claimed that Yael acted in bad faith hiding crucial information from Orian.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn response, Yael argued that she and Orian intended to establish a joint venture to monetize her invention. Yael claimed that the parties agreed that the invention was hers but that it was agreed to set up a mutual business and share future revenues of the commercialization of the invention. Yael showed pertinent e-mails to the court demonstrating that Orian knew about the filing of the applications and that Orian even agreed verbally that the patent applications will be filed in her name. Yael argued that if she had really acted in a fraudulent way as claimed by Orian, then why she had not been fired on the spot?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Court found that the language of Section 132 contains four cumulative conditions required to determine that the invention belongs to the employer. The four conditions enumerated by the Court are as follows: (1) there is an invention; (2) employer-employee relationship exists between the parties; (3) the employee reached the invention within the framework of his employment; (4) the employee reached the invention during the term of employment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAccording to the decision, the burden of proof that all the four conditions are met is placed on the employer. The court stated that Section 132 provides that the employer must prove that the invention is his. This result is consistent with the presumption of ownership stated in Section 76 of the Patents Law which states that a person who submitted a patent application deemed the owner of the invention, as long as the contrary has not been proven.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSection 132 also provides for three exemptions under which the invention shall be the property of the employee: (1) an agreement stipulating that the invention shall be the property of the employee; (2) the employer released the invention to the employee within six months after the employee provided notice to the employer of the invention; (3) the employer failed to protest within the 6 months from the date the employee provided such notice.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith respect to the above exemptions, the burden of proof that the parties reached "a different agreement" is rested on the person claiming this argument - Yael. The burden of proof that Orian gave up its rights for the invention was also placed on Yael.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe court stated that an agreement specifying that the invention shall be the property of the employee – is like any other agreements and may be concluded in writing, orally or implied by conduct.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, Orian gave several different versions on whether or not there was an agreement with respect to the ownership of the patent. On the other hand, Yael was always consistent with her version of the facts that Orian agreed verbally that the applications will be filed in Yael''s name (this based on various conversations and e-mails exchanged between the parties). In view of important contradictions within Orian''s versions, the court preferred Yael''s testimony, and concluded that Orian knew of the filing of the applications in the name of Yael, and that between Orian and Yael existed an agreement as to ownership in the invention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOrian also argued that Yael did not notify about the invention, contrary to Section 131 of the Patents Law. The court rejected this argument and stated that Orian knew and agreed that the inventions would be filed on Yael''s name. The court therefore provides that if an employer knows of the employee’s invention and of his intent to file a patent application in his name, the requirements under Section 131 to provide notice are fulfilled.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Court dismissed Orian''s claim and decided that Yael will remain the sole owner of the invention. The court awarded NIS 60,000 in costs to Yael.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nComment\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Court analyzed carefully the factual circumstances surrounding the case and specifically the relationship between the parties – the court then concluded that Yael was more than a simple employee and in fact Yael should be considered as a kind of business partner with respect to the invention she developed while working for Orian.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt first, the decision seems surprising and somehow disturbing for employers, but when reviewing the actual facts and specific details of this case, we believe that the conclusion of the decision is correct. According to the specific evidences adduced by the parties, it seems that Orian did clearly let Yael file the applications in her own name. The court also indicated that Orian was greedy by claiming that 100% of the rights on the invention belonged to him - had Orian requested only 50% of the invention rights, it may have had an impact on the outcome of the decision.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRecommendation\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBased on the conclusion of the Court, employers should pay attention to immediately have the employees sign specific assignment agreements before filing of the patent application. Employers should also be aware that notification under Section 131 can be given orally by employees - employers should immediately react and protest as soon as they are aware that an employee is about to file an application in his own name.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Warning signal to employers regarding service inventions', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'warning-signal-to-employers-regarding-service-inventions', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:50:39', '2013-10-16 11:50:39', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=690', 0, 'post', '', 0);

The law is the most extensive overhaul of the U.S. Patent system since 1952.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile the change to first to file is the most publicized change in the law, other changes will probably have a greater effect on patent practice, especially for Israeli companies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe major changes that are relevant to most will be discussed below:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst to File (effective March 16, 2013)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe law will effectively switch the U.S. Patent system from the present "first-to- invent" system to a "first-to-file" system, bringing it into harmony with most other worldwide patent systems.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nActs and prior art that bar a patent will include public use, sales, publications, and other disclosures available to the public as of the effective filing date, other than publications by the inventor or those who obtained the publication from the inventor, within a one year "grace period" before filing. All these acts will be universal and public use and offer for sale anywhere in the world are now prior art.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nForeign filings of applications used for priority of US applications can be used against a third parties application as of the date the priority application is filed. These priority applications can be used to establish both anticipation and obviousness.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInterference proceedings at the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for resolving priority contests among near-simultaneous inventors who both file applications for the same invention are repealed because priority will be determined based on filing date.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn administrative proceeding—called a “derivation” proceeding, is provided to ensure that the first person to file the application did not derive the invention from another inventor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nGrace Period for Filing (effective March 16, 2013)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe extent of the grace period for filing is substantially changed. In effect, first to file is also first to disclose. Under the new law, one can overcome a prior publication only when the publication is Applicant''s own or is made by another who derived the information directly or indirectly from the inventor.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe grace period thus applies only to the work of the inventor and also to those who have an obligation to assign to the same party as does the inventor (for example, where they work for the same company).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFiling by Assignee (effective September 16, 2012)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAn assignee will be permitted to file an application on behalf of an inventor who assigned, or is under an obligation to assign the invention rights to the assignee, without seeking the inventor''s execution of the application.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBest Mode (effective immediately, including pending litigation)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough the patent application will still be required to set forth the best mode for practicing the invention, the law would exclude failure to disclose a best mode from being used as a basis for invalidating a granted patent.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarking (effective immediately)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOther than a person who can prove competitive injury, only the US government will be able to bring a false marking lawsuit.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVirtual marking, by marking the product pat., and providing a web address that lists the patents is now specifically provided for.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarking with an expired patent number is no longer a violation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThird Party Citations (effective September 16, 2012, but applies retroactively)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne can submit patents, patent applications and other publications as prior art for consideration against a published third party application up to the earlier of (a) the date of a notice of allowance of (b) the later of six months from the publication date of that application or the issuance of a first rejection of any claim by the Examiner. The submission must set forth the asserted relevance of the document.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition, after the issuance of a patent, third parties may file prior art and any statements made by the patentee before a federal court or the PTO taking a position on the meaning of the claims. A statement by the third party explaining relevance may also be filed. All these filings will become part of the file of the patent.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPost Grant Procedures\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe entire range of post grant procedures is being changed. Only reissue and ex parte reexamination are unchanged. In addition to the derivation procedure described above, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNew Supplemental Examination\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA new procedure has been introduced to allow patentees to have the USPTO consider or reconsider of information believed to be relevant to an issued patent. There is no deadline for this request. The examination will take place if the patentee raises a substantial new issue of patentability. This provision is especially important in that it will allow a patentee to cite information that was not cited during prosecution. The fact that the information was not cited earlier can not be used to declare the patent unenforceable.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInter Partes reviews (effective September 16, 2012)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the old inter partes reexamination with the following main changes. The standard for declaring a review has is changed from “a substantial new issue of patentability” to “a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner will prevail with respect to at least one claim.” The limitation that review is based only on anticipation and obviousness remains in force. In addition, if the petitioner is a party to a suit then he can not file a request for review. This is meant to keep infringers from delaying court proceedings by filing reexaminations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNew Post Grant Review (for most patents, effective March 16, 2013)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA third party can file a request within 9 months after issue of the patent. Unlike Europe, the declaration of the review is not automatic, but the USPTO must decide if the opponent demonstrates that it is more likely than not that he will prevail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote that when an Inter Partes procedures is filed the party is estopped from raising any issue in court that was raised or could have been raised in the USPTO.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA. A "micro entity" who is a small entity that has been named on less than four applications, and whose gross income is less than three times the median household income (which totals approximately $149,000) will be able to pay half the small entity fee rates.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nB.

(696, 2, '2012-09-01 11:52:35', '2012-09-01 11:52:35', '<p style="text-align: right;">ביום 1 באוגוסט 2012, ניתן פסק הדין בבקשת רשות ערעור אשר הוגשה על ידי ד"ר נמרוד בייר (המערער) כנגד חברת פלוראליטי בע"מ (חברה בפירוק) וכנגד מפרק החברה (רוני רביע רו"ח ועו"ד). בית המשפט העליון קבע בפסק דין תקדימי בעניין זה, כי חתימתו של עובד על הסכם לפיו לא יהיה זכאי לתמורה או תמלוגים בגין אמצאת שירות, לא תתפרש בהכרח כוויתור על זכותו של העובד לתבוע, על אף ההסכם ועל אף שמשכורתו שולמה במלואה, תמורה ממעבידו עבור אמצאתו.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">עניין זה, העלה פעם נוספת את סוגיית פרשנות חוק הפטנטים, התשכ"ז-1967 (להלן: "חוק הפטנטים") בעניין התמורה בעד אמצאות המפותחות על ידי עובדים במקום עבודתם, קרי אמצאות שירות. סוגיה זו, טומנת בחובה שאלות משמעותיות עבור המעסיק והעובד, בין השאר האם העובד זכאי לבעלות חלקית או מלאה על אמצאותיו והאם מגיעה לעובד תמורה כספית או אחרת עבור אמצאתו?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">סעיף 132 לחוק הפטנטים, קובע כי ככלל זכות הקניין באמצאה אשר פותחה על ידי עובד במהלך עבודתו תוקנה למעביד ובלבד שלא הוסכם אחרת בין הצדדים. כמו כן, סעיף 134 לחוק הפטנטים קובע כי באין הסכם הקובע אם העובד זכאי לתמורה בעד אמצאתו ומהו סכום התמורה, תובא השאלה לפתחה של הוועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים. מעסיקים רבים, בחרו להתמודד עם שאלת פרשנותו של חוק הפטנטים באמצעות הכנסת אותן סוגיות הנתונות לפרשנות, להסכמי העבודה אשר ניסחו ועליהם החתימו את עובדיהם. כך למשל, הסכמי עבודה רבים מכילים סעיף הקובע כי הוראות חוק הפטנטים לא יחולו על הצדדים.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">בעניין הנדון, טען המערער כי הנו הממציא של הטכנולוגיה אשר היוותה את בסיס קיומה של החברה. למעשה, ביקש המערער רשות לפתוח בהליכים כנגד החברה, המתבססת על טענתו בדבר זכותו לקבל תמלוגים בגין אמצאת שירות. הסכם העבודה בין הצדדים, לעניין סוגיית "אמצאות וזכויות יוצרים", קבע כי כל אמצאה, לרבות אמצאת שירות כהגדרתה בחוק הפטנטים, יהיו קניינה של החברה. כלומר, הממציא לא יהיה זכאי לכל תשלום, תמורה או תמלוגים בעד האמצאה מלבד הסכומים להם זכאי על-פי אותו הסכם. עם זאת, טען המערער כי הוועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים, אשר הוקמה על-פי הוראת סעיף 134 לחוק הפטנטים, היא אשר אמורה לברר את המחלוקת בינו לבין החברה לעניין אמצאת השירות.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">כפי שצוין במזכר מחודש פברואר 2010, הוועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים קבעה בהחלטה בעניין Actelis Networks נ'' אילני, כי סעיף 134 לחוק הפטנטים ניתן לפרשנות כפולה: ניתן לפרשו כחל רק כאשר אין כל הסכם בין העובד לבין המעביד, או כחל גם במקרה שבו קיים הסכם אך ההסכם שולל את הזכות לפיצויים או לתמלוגים.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">בעניין זה, קבעה הועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים כי אין לשלול את אפשרות סמכותה של הוועדה, מכוח סעיף 134 האמור, לדון גם בתביעה של עובד אשר בהסכם שבינו לבין המעסיק נשללה זכותו לתמלוגים. בנוסף נפסק, כי לא ניתן לשלול על הסף את האפשרות שהוועדה, ואולי הוועדה בלבד, מוסמכת לדון בטענות המבקש לעניין זכותו לתמלוגים בגין אמצאת שירות ואף שקיימת זכות שכזו.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">בעניין זה, קיבל בית המשפט המחוזי את הפירוש הראשון לסעיף 134 לחוק הפטנטים, היינו כי הסעיף חל רק כאשר אין כלל הסכם בין העובד לבין המעביד, אשר נקבע כאמור בעניין Actelis Networks נ'' אילני. בית המשפט המחוזי בדחייתו את הבקשה, הכריע למעשה בשאלת משמעות הסכם העבודה בין הצדדים, לרבות פירושו ותוקפו, כמו גם בעניין הזכות לתמלוגים, לרבות הגורם המוסמך להכריע בה. בית המשפט קבע בהכרעתו, כי לנוכח הוראת הסכם העבודה ולפי הוראת סעיף 134 לחוק הפטנטים, אין לוועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים סמכות לדון בטענות העותר כנגד החברה. החלטה זו של בית המשפט המחוזי בוטלה על ידי בית המשפט העליון. בית המשפט העליון קבע, כי אין בהוראות ההסכם שבין הצדדים כדי לשלול על הסף את האפשרות שיש למבקש טענה לכאורית בעניין זכותו לתגמולים ואת האפשרות שמחלוקת זו אמורה להתברר בפני הוועדה.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">למעשה, פסק דין תקדימי זה קובע כי לוועדה לענייני פיצויים ותמלוגים סמכות לבטל תנאי בהסכם עבודה אשר שולל מעובד זכות לקבלת פיצויים ותמלוגים בגין עבודתו. יתרה על כך, בית המשפט העליון אף מציין כי ייתכן והזכות לתמורה בעד אמצאת שירות הנה זכות אשר אינה ניתנת לוויתור והמהווה חלק בלתי נפרד ממשפט העבודה המגן.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">פסק הדין האמור הנו בעל השפעה ישירה על מעסיקים וחברות רבות במשק, בייחוד חברות בענף ההיי-טק. חברות רבות מסתמכות על הסכמי העבודה אשר ניסחו ועליהם חתומים עובדיהם, הכוללים סעיף השולל את התמורה בגין אמצאת שירות. יש לציין, כי הוועדה לפיצויים ותמלוגים טרם קיבלה החלטה סופית בעניין זה. עם זאת, הדבר אינו מפחית מחשיבותו של פסק הדין, אשר יוצר פתח לפניית עובד לערכאות השיפוטיות אף שבהסכם עבודתו נשללה זכותו זו.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: right;"></p>', 'פסק דין תקדימי בעניין הזכות של עובדי מחקר ופיתוח לתמורה בעד אמצאת שירות', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', '%d7%a4%d7%a1%d7%a7-%d7%93%d7%99%d7%9f-%d7%aa%d7%a7%d7%93%d7%99%d7%9e%d7%99-%d7%91%d7%a2%d7%a0%d7%99%d7%99%d7%9f-%d7%94%d7%96%d7%9b%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%a9%d7%9c-%d7%a2%d7%95%d7%91%d7%93%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%97', '', '', '2013-10-16 11:53:23', '2013-10-16 11:53:23', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=696', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Nevertheless, the present state of the law, although tentative, appears to lead to a\r\nsimilar result, namely that that if the claim as a whole has a “technical” effect, software\r\nbased methods are patentable (in the EPO) and software that causes a transformation of a tangible\r\nobject or is tied to a particular apparatus (in the US) is patentable.\r\nThese two approaches sometimes lead to different results because of differing definition and\r\nbecause many cases in the EPO tend to consider the non-technical limitations as though they were\r\nprior art.\r\nIn Israel, due to the small number of court cases and decisions of the registrar, the state of the\r\nlaw is more unclear and contradictory decisions have lead to uncertainty as to what is patentable.\r\nMoreover, the standards for patentability are very tentative and are currently being reconsidered\r\nin all three jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<em><em>\r\nUSA\r\nIn the US, the landmark case of In re Bilski, a classic business method patent application, was\r\ndecided by the Circuit Court for the Federal District (CAFC) in October\r\n2008 (by a decision of the entire panel of the CAFC). This decision severely limited the scope not\r\nonly of business method patents but also of patents for other methods dealing with intangibles,\r\nwhere the scope of patentable subject matter is in question including the software, medical,\r\ndiagnostic and genetic fields. The USPTO issued extremely limiting guidelines in the wake of In re\r\nBilski. Bilski confirmed the transformation or particular apparatus test for patentability of all\r\nmethod claims (including software and business claims).</em></em>\r\n\r\n<em><em>\r\nWith the acceptance of the case by the US Supreme Court and possibly under the influence of the\r\nnew commissioner appointed by President Obama, new tentative and somewhat more reasonable\r\nguidelines have now been issued.

In the EPO, which has a two tier appeal system, different appeal boards have come\r\nto different conclusions regarding the patentability of various software implemented patents. As a\r\nresult, the president of the EPO has referred this entire question of the extent to which\r\nsoftware based patents can be granted to the Enlarged Board of Appeals for a decision and\r\nclarification of the extent of protection available (if any). Unfortunately, the appeal process in\r\nthe Enlarged Board is usually quite slow and it would be surprising if a resolution is reached in\r\nthe short term. Furthermore, it is impossible to predict the outcome of this process.\r\nThe situation in Europe is complicated by the fact that the judicial systems of each member decide\r\npatentability issues and the EPO is not bound by these decisions. All jurisdictions are generally\r\nbound by the European patent convention, but one can expect interpretations to vary with respect\r\nto such a complex issue. The validity of patents in each country is bound by local judicial\r\ndecisions. To the extent that these differ from the EPO guidelines, the result might be that a\r\npatent secured under the EPO guidelines would not be valid in some countries or it might be\r\nimpossible to secure protection in the EPO that would be valid in at least some countries.\r\nIsrael\r\nIn Israel, there is no clear general policy pertaining to the registration of computer software\r\npatents. The lack of policy is, inter alia, an outcome of the limited number of cases which have\r\nbeen reviewed by the Israeli courts,\r\nnone by the Israeli Supreme court.\r\nGeneral guidelines may be found in the landmark judgment App. 23/94 United Technologies Corp. which\r\nwas decided more than a decade ago by the district court. In this judgment, Judge Brenner held\r\nthat the invention under discussion, software for improving helicopters’ fuel injection system,\r\nshould be granted with a patent as it controls hardware that induces a tangible effect. In his\r\nanalysis, Judge Brenner argued that the fact that part of the invention is a software process does\r\nnot exclude it from patentability. It should be noted that though this judgment clarifies the\r\npatentability of an invention combining software process and designated hardware, such as avionic\r\nsystem, it is silent about the patentability of an invention combining software process and\r\ngeneral purpose hardware, such as a server, a processor, or a personal computer.\r\nThe lack of a clear policy is reflected by inconsistencies in decisions made by the ILPTO. During\r\nthe last few years, the Israeli registrar has published a number of decisions in which software\r\nbased inventions were reviewed according to different rules and/or principles. Moreover, leading\r\npatent attorneys in the field find it hard to estimate which subject matter will be accepted by the\r\nexaminers of the ILPTO and which will not. Similar to the trends in the USPTO and the EPO, the\r\nILPTO currently is acting to scrutinize the issue. On October 15, 2009, the registrar held a\r\nmeeting at the ILPTO with representatives of the Israeli patent attorneys association, the Israeli\r\nbranch of the AIPPI organization and the Israeli bar association, including Roy Melzer of Ehrlich &amp;\r\nFenster, to discuss how software related patents should be examined. As the ILPTO has recently\r\nbeen appointed as an international searching and preliminary examining authority under the PCT,\r\nit seems safe to assume that the ILPTO will take efforts to have its procedures correspond with\r\nthose in Europe and the USA and develop a clearer policy regarding software\r\npatents.', 'Patenting Software and Methods of Doing Business', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'patenting-software-and-methods-of-doing-business', '', '', '2013-10-16 12:31:24', '2013-10-16 12:31:24', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=707', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It means that on 1st September 2010, Israeli trademark owners will finally be able to file International Trademark Applications under the Madrid Protocol.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Madrid Protocol?\r\n\r\nThe Madrid Protocol provides an alternative to national trademark filings. Under the Madrid Protocol, Israeli trademark owners will have the option to register a trademark in all or several member countries that have joined the Madrid Protocol (see list below) by filing a single international trademark application.\r\n\r\nFor example, this will permit an Israeli Applicant to make a filing in USA, Japan, China and\r\nEuropean Community countries by filing a single trademark application. It will not be necessary\r\nanymore to use local Associates on a country-by country basis to effect a filing in these\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWhat is the main advantage offered by the Madrid Protocol?\r\n\r\nThe principal benefit of the Madrid Protocol is of course the reduced costs (comparing to multiple\r\nindividual filings) as local associates will not be required anymore to effect the filing. Also,\r\nrenewal and/or changes of ownership will be recorded by WIPO in one single operation rather\r\nthan separately in each jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWhat is required to file an international application under the Madrid Protocol?\r\n\r\nIn order to file an international trademark application under the Madrid Protocol, the applicant\r\nmust own a trademark application or registration in ISRAEL for the identical mark with the same or\r\na wider specification of goods and services.\r\n\r\nWhat is the primary disadvantage of the <em id="__mceDel" style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><em id="__mceDel">Madrid Protocol?</em></em>\r\n\r\nAs noted above, in order to get an international trademark registration, an applicant must first\r\nown an Israeli trademark application or registration.\r\n\r\nThe major problem of the Madrid Protocol is that the International trademark registration is\r\ndependant on the Israeli basic application or registration for five (5) years from the\r\ninternational registration date.

These two\r\ncan be in conflict unless care is taken both in securing the regulatory approval and in securing\r\nthe IP protection. The core conflict is easily stated. In preparing and prosecuting a patent\r\napplication an important objective is to show substantive differences between the prior art and the\r\ndevice being patented. In securing quick regulatory approval it can be extremely helpful to show\r\nthat the device for which approval is sought is substantially equivalent to a prior “predicate”\r\ndevice. This conflict can manifest itself in three major ways.\r\n\r\nII: Patentability Issues\r\n\r\nThe first of these are issues that may be raised is statements in the regulatory filings (not just\r\nFDA filings) which contradict the positions typically taken vis-à-vis the patent office by\r\nminimizing novelty and/or suggesting the obviousness of the patent claims. Statements that are\r\ngenerally most problematic are those which identify a predicate device as being substantially\r\nequivalent and the subsequent comparison of the operation of the new device such that the\r\ndifferences are minimized. This is in contrast to the way the same differences may be presented in\r\nthe patent application or in subsequent prosecution. Another way in which patentability may be\r\ncalled into question is when the FDA filing is available to the public prior to filing of the\r\npatent application. The disclosure of the FDA filing may, in fact, be a disclosure of the\r\ninvention. For devices which require a PMA, the parts of the PMA that are public are also\r\nconsidered\r\n\r\npublications which may destroy novelty, suggest obviousness\r\nor obviousness to try. This kind of publication is especially damaging to patent applications\r\noutside the US where there is no grace period for self-publications.\r\n\r\nIII: Infringement Issues\r\n\r\nA second issue is that statements made by a party (for example, but not limited to) when filing\r\nfor regulatory approval may set that party up for a claim of patent infringement. We have had a\r\ncase in which a patent holder presented a local manufacturer with “proof” of infringement based\r\non statements made in a 510(k) filing. While for infringement purposes the alleged infringing\r\ndevice should be compared to the patent and not to the patentee’s product, statements made in\r\nregulatory filings can be very harmful to the defendant’s position.\r\n\r\nIII: Information Disclosure Issues\r\n\r\nA third area of concern is the duty of disclosure to the US (and Israel) patent office. Failure to\r\nproperly carry out this duty can result in the entire patent being unenforceable, even if otherwise\r\nvalid and infringed. In the US, the applicant has to bring any information that a US Examiner\r\nmay consider to be material to patentability to the examiner’s attention. Especially relevant are\r\nstatements made elsewhere that may contradict statements made to the patent office. One result of\r\nthis obligation\r\nis the necessity to report all comparisons made to predicate devices to the US patent office.\r\nAdditionally, one should report any patents which the manufacturer may have on the predicate\r\ndevice of which you are aware. The comparison made between the predicate device and the device for\r\nwhich approval is sought should also be disclosed as well as any explanation of the new device\r\nmade to the regulatory authorities. For devices which\r\nrequire a PMA, the public parts of the PMA are prior art from the time they appear on the web site\r\nof the FDA. However, even the confidential parts can be considered material and need to be\r\nreported, for example if they conflict with statements made to the USPTO or in the patent\r\napplication. One can expect that during litigation even the confidential parts will be disclosed to\r\nthe attorneys for the patentee.\r\n\r\nIV: Conclusion and Recommendations\r\n\r\nIt is possible, in great measure, to mitigate the problems inherent in the contradictory aims of\r\nthe regulatory and patenting processes. A complete discussion of the ways to avoid problems is\r\nbeyond the scope of this short paper. However, an important first step is to have an integrated\r\napproach between the regulatory side and the patent side. While patent attorneys are not qualified\r\nto judge the adequacy of regulatory filings, regulatory advisors are seldom experienced enough to\r\ndetermine the effects of such statements on patentability or liability for infringement. It is\r\nstrongly recommended that any regulatory filings (original or responsive) be vetted by the patent\r\nattorney before it is filed and that all filings are brought to the attention of the patent\r\nattorney so that an informed decision as to what should be disclosed to the patent office can be\r\nmade. Better yet, there should be a joint strategy developed, at the outset, by the various people\r\ninvolved (company, regulatory advisor and patent attorney) as to how best to secure a both high\r\nspeed of approval and quality of protection of IP, while minimizing the need to trade one off\r\nagainst the other.', 'Avoiding Conflict Between IP and Regulation', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'avoiding-conflict-between-ip-and-regulation', '', '', '2013-10-16 13:01:03', '2013-10-16 13:01:03', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=717', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The Bill is subject to coordination with the Ministry of Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was published following the execution of an agreement, signed in February this year,\r\nbetween Israel and the U.S. regarding the protection of intellectual property\r\nin the pharmaceutical market in Israel.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Bill is to increase the verifiability for\r\npharmaceutical companies by reducing the number of the reference states in which the term of\r\ngranting a marketing permit may serve as basis to the calculation of the extension period in\r\nIsrael, and by providing a fast route for early examination of applications for patent extensions.\r\nAccording to the Israeli Ministry Of Justice, the Bill further enhances the certainty for\r\npharmaceutical companies by opening the Israeli market to some generic medicines at an earlier\r\nstage. The Israeli Ministry Of Justice further contends that such rectification of the Patents\r\nLaw will provide more certainty in planning of the required state budget to the acquisition of\r\npharmaceutical products and medical equipment.\r\nThe Bill includes the following substantive\r\namendments:\r\n\r\nReducing the “two states rule” list - Under the “two states rule” (Article 64D[5]-64D[6] of the\r\nPatents Law), an extension of the patent term is granted in Israel in cases in which patent\r\nprotection extensions were granted in the United States and in one of the European states listed\r\nin Annex 1(b) to the Patents Law regarding a specified pharmaceutical product, before a\r\nrespective patent has expired in Israel. The amendment remove Greece, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nHolland, Luxemburg, Portugal, Finland, and Sweden from the list, leaving only France, Italy,\r\nEngland, and Germany as such potential additional European states. The extension period in Israel\r\nis set according to the shortest extension period between the patent protection extension granted\r\nin the United States and in one of the above European countries.\r\n\r\nChanging the examination procedure of the extension\r\nrequests - In framework of the suggested amendments, a number of additional procedural rules were\r\nset. For example, a time frame for the examination procedure was defined. In addition, a demand\r\nfor the submission of an early notice by the Ministry of Justice, pertaining to the acceptance of\r\na request for patent protection extension was set forth, as well as an early pre-grant opposition\r\nprocedure for such acceptance (on grounds different from a post grant opposition). Moreover, a\r\nprocedure for filing a pre- grant request for a patent extension term was proposed.\r\n\r\nClarifying which type of extensions, granted in the United States or in one of the additional\r\nEuropean states, may serve as reference extensions.\r\nAs mentioned, the Bill is currently at the consultation\r\nstage.

The Bill is subject to coordination with the Ministry of Treasury.\n\nThe Bill was published following the execution of an agreement, signed in February this year,\nbetween Israel and the U.S. regarding the protection of intellectual property\nin the pharmaceutical market in Israel.\n\nThe purpose of the Bill is to increase the verifiability for\npharmaceutical companies by reducing the number of the reference states in which the term of\ngranting a marketing permit may serve as basis to the calculation of the extension period in\nIsrael, and by providing a fast route for early examination of applications for patent extensions.\nAccording to the Israeli Ministry Of Justice, the Bill further enhances the certainty for\npharmaceutical companies by opening the Israeli market to some generic medicines at an earlier\nstage. The Israeli Ministry Of Justice further contends that such rectification of the Patents\nLaw will provide more certainty in planning of the required state budget to the acquisition of\npharmaceutical products and medical equipment.\nThe Bill includes the following substantive\namendments:\n\nReducing the “two states rule” list - Under the “two states rule” (Article 64D[5]-64D[6] of the\nPatents Law), an extension of the patent term is granted in Israel in cases in which patent\nprotection extensions were granted in the United States and in one of the European states listed\nin Annex 1(b) to the Patents Law regarding a specified pharmaceutical product, before a\nrespective patent has expired in Israel. The amendment remove Greece, Ireland, Belgium, Denmark,\nHolland, Luxemburg, Portugal, Finland, and Sweden from the list, leaving only France, Italy,\nEngland, and Germany as such potential additional European states.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability).

These countries are said to operate an "absolute novelty" requirement. Examples of acts that can make an invention available to the public are written or electronic publications, sales, public oral disclosures and public demonstrations or use.\n\nIt is therefore very important to file your patent application before it is disclosed or published somewhere. But what if the invention has been published before you had an opportunity to file a patent application thereon? Is it in the public domain, or can the inventor still have one last chance to file for a patent?\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, a grace period exists for protecting an inventor or successor in title from authorized or unauthorized disclosure of the invention before the filing date. That is, if the inventor or the successor in title publishes the invention, an application can still be validly filed which will be considered novel despite the publication, provided that the filing is made during the grace period following the publication. The grace period is usually 6 or 12 months.\n\nSome absolute novelty countries provide a limited grace period for certain disclosures, which are limited to very limited circumstances. Examples of such circumstances include unauthorized disclosures by third parties who derive the invention from the applicant or presentations by the applicant before officially recognized academic societies. These limited grace periods typically provide for several months for the applicant to file a patent application, and require the applicant to inform the respective patent office about the earlier publication at the time of filing of the patent application.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCountries that have a twelve month grace period include, inter alia, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Korea, Brazil, Australia, Argentina and the Ukraine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRussia is an example of a country that has a six month grace period.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCountries that have a limited grace period (typically six month grace period) include, inter alia, Europe (includes Germany, France, U.K, Italy, Spain), China, Japan, Israel, Taiwan and India.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe above information should not be taken as legal advice. Please consult with your patent attorney before relying on the above information.
