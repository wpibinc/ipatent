Here&#8217;s a bit more about some of the new features, which you can also find on the about page in your dashboard after you upgrade.</p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<p><img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://wordpress.org/images/core/3.6/twentythirteen.png" width="300" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>new Twenty Thirteen theme</strong> inspired by modern art puts focus on your content with a colorful, single-column design made for media-rich blogging.</li>\n<li><strong>Revamped Revisions</strong> save every change and the new interface allows you to scroll easily through changes to see line-by-line who changed what and when.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking</strong> and <strong>Augmented Autosave</strong> will especially be a boon to sites where more than a single author is working on a post. Each author now has their own autosave stream, which stores things locally as well as on the server (so much harder to lose something) and there&#8217;s an interface for taking over editing of a post, as demonstrated beautifully by our bearded buddies in the video above.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in HTML5 media player</strong> for native audio and video embeds with no reliance on external services.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Menu Editor</strong> is now much easier to understand and use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A new audio/video API gives you access to metadata like ID3 tags.</li>\n<li>You can now choose HTML5 markup for things like comment and search forms, and comment lists.</li>\n<li>Better filters for how revisions work, so you can store a different amount of history for different post types.</li>\n<li>Tons more <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6">listed on the Codex</a>, and of course you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.6">browse the over 700 closed tickets</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Band</h3>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="http://markjaquith.com/">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href="http://geekreprieve.com/">Aaron Campbell</a>, and included contributions from the following fine folks. Pull up some Oscar Peterson on your music service of choice, or vinyl if you have it, and check out some of their profiles:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/technosailor">Aaron Brazell</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I&#8217;m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you.

We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities.

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:12:33 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 21:49:34 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130708073815";}', 'no');

As the technology of podcasting became more prevalent and easier to produce, there were many new productions about WordPress that came and went. Recently though, there have been a lot of really good shows that have been released on a regular basis that have provided a well-rounded set of listening choices. I believe the time has come to engage in a community based strategic alliance of these shows in the form of a 24/7 streaming audio station. <span id="more-8543"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Thus, the formation of <a title="WordPress Radio" href="http://wpr.fm">WPR.FM</a>. WordPress Radio.</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPRFM.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8550" alt="WordPress Radio" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPRFM.jpg?resize=300%2C168" /></a>At first, I was unsure how to go about starting a streaming radio station. As a podcaster of 8+ years, streaming was always viewed as the &#8220;old&#8221; way of doing things. This was more commonly profiled due to lack of bandwidth or mobile portability. Nowadays with modern carrier technology able to stream anywhere we are, I feel the stars have aligned to create an audio channel that&#8217;s all ours. I approached my friend &#8220;Mr. Oil&#8221; who runs <a title="Fralnet" href="http://fralnet.com">FralNet</a>, a UK-based host provider and he liked the idea so much that he graciously offered to help get us up and running at no cost! He helped me with the setup, and in 10 minutes, we were streaming to the world!</p>\n<p>Now that the connections were made and the &#8220;on-air light&#8221; has been illuminated, it&#8217;s time to get the DJ&#8217;s in their proper rotation. Ideally we would like to see the following shows in the programming lineup: <a title="WordPress Weekly" href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> with Jeff Chandler, <a title="Wordpress Plugins A-Z Podcast" href="http://wppluginsatoz.com">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> with John Overall and Marcus Couch, <a title="Your Website Engineer" href="http://yourwebsiteengineer.com/">Your Website Engineer</a> with Dustin Hartzler, <a title="The WordPress Chick" href="http://thewpchick.com">The WordPress Chick</a> with Kim Doyal, <a title="WP Water Cooler" href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/">WP Watercooler</a> with Chris Lema, Jeff Tucker and cast, <a title="DradCast" href="http://dradcast.com/">DradCast</a> with Brad Williams and Dre Armeda, <a title="Matt Report" href="http://mattreport.com/">Matt Report</a> with Matt Medeiros, <a title="Weekly Web Tools" href="http://weeklywebtools.com">Weekly Web Tools</a> with Dave Jackson and others like <a title="WP Bacon" href="http://wpbacon.com/">WP Bacon</a>, <a title="Apply Filters" href="http://applyfilters.fm/">Apply Filters</a> and my own 3 minute news segment of The Daily Plugin. And that&#8217;s just who I listen to. There are probably tons more that I am missing.</p>\n<p>From an additional content perspective, how cool would it be to get Q&amp;A segments from WordCamps or Meetup Groups? How about a monthly &#8220;Industry Night&#8221; show where <strong>EVERYONE</strong> who produces a show all gets on a call and goes around the table talking WordPress? I think our community would get a lot of benefit from this. We also have the ability to stream live, so the possibilities are only limited by what content is available to us.</p>\n<h2>So we have a WordPress stream, now what?</h2>\n<p><strong>Site Design and Development</strong><br />\nThe next phase will be site builds and profiles for all the content, shows and presenters. This is where I am looking for the community for help.

There have been at least a couple of instances where I have pressed OK thinking that the After The Deadline spell checker would Update my post with the necessary corrections or, allow me to actually update the errors in the post but instead, end up publishing the post. I think the most important wording that needs to be changed is the part that says &#8220;<em>Press OK To Update Your Post</em>&#8220;.  So I&#8217;m throwing this out to everyone else to not only see how many people have mistakenly pressed OK only to have their post be published or scheduled, but also ask what do you think the wording of this prompt should be changed to? While were at it, perhaps I&#8217;m the only one screwing things up around here and it&#8217;s not really a problem. After all, I believe the prompt has been this way for a long time.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/axRljp_6i7M" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 05:09:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"Lorelle on WP: Fall 2013 WordPress College Courses";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=10115";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/fall-2013-wordpress-college-courses/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:521:"Registration is now open for the two WordPress college courses I teach at Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, and Portland Community College at Rock Creek in Beaverton, just west of Portland, Oregon.

WP-ABTesting took some time out to answer a few questions I had about their service. <span id="more-8521"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTestingLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8531" alt="WP AB Testing Logo" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTestingLogo.jpg?resize=435%2C75" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about the WP AB Testing service.</strong></p>\n<p>We provide a <span>native</span> conversion optimization service for WordPress sites. Our aim is to increase your conversion rates (whatever your conversion goal is: more sign-ups, sales, visitors,&#8230;) in a systematic and scientific way. Opinions are great but only if they are used to start a data-driven experiment to (dis)prove them before deciding on whether to implement them or not. Nobody (not even you) is good enough to predict what will work for your site.</p>\n<p>At the core of our service you have an A/B testing (also known as split testing) mechanism. In its simplest form, A/B testing works by predefining two or more alternatives for a given post or page and the conversion goal you want to achieve with them, and then randomly showing those alternatives to your visitors to check which one works better, i.e. which one has a higher conversion rate. For instance, you may want to create two alternative versions of your landing page, show 50% of the time each alternative and monitor which one makes more of your visitors to sign-up for your mailing list. Once the results are statistically significant (don’t be scared, we will hide all the math from you, just keep reading!) you consolidate the winning alternative and start again with a new test.</p>\n<p><strong>What will WP AB Testing have that may not be found in plugins or other similar services?</strong></p>\n<p>Most tools focus on the classic AB testing: you define the tests and the tools report on the number of conversions of each alternative. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>Our service goes beyond this in two main directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>-</strong> Technical level. We don’t want to restrict people to test only posts / pages with a standard AB Testing algorithm. Since our service is a native WordPress solution we can offer fine-grained tests in which other WordPress components (like menus, widgets or the theme itself) can be tested as well. Then, the plug-in automatically evolves the site based on the results of those tests (obviously, only if you want the plug-in to do that for you). We’ll also complement A/B testing with other testing / optimization strategies like greedy algorithms and heat maps to offer a better picture of what’s going on in the site. Another example we have in our future roadmap is to enable the use of social metrics as conversion goals (i.e. an alternative post is better if it gets reshared more times) which we believe can be interesting for some sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>-</strong> Personalization level. Raw data on the percentage of improvement of an alternative may be enough for math savvy users but won’t do much for the rest. We believe in A/B testing for everybody which means that our service will help people to understand the meaning of the numbers they see to make an informed decision. And, more importantly, for those that want a more hassle-free experience, we will offer a personalized service where one of our company experts will suggest possible tests for your site (e.g. based on ours and the community experience on what has worked in other sites in the same domain) and even create and monitor the tests for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is AB Testing an important practice to conduct on websites from time to time?</strong></p>\n<p>First, I&#8217;d like to “challenge” the fact that AB Testing should be done “from time to time”. In our opinion, you should always be optimizing your site. Even if some optimizations may only bring a small improvement, they add up so the overall effect may well surprise you!.</p>\n<p>A second reason, which is not usually mentioned, is that you are going to learn a lot about your site and your business when doing A/B tests. Many  people regard A/B tests as mere small changes on the look and feel of your site (e.g. changing the color of a button here, increasing the size of an image there,&#8230;) but they can be much more powerful than that. I regard them as a learning tool for the business owner. Just thinking about possible tests gives you a perfect excuse to reconsider your business assumptions and offers a low-risk approach to test alternative approaches that otherwise you would have never dared to try. And if the test fails (meaning that your current version doesn’t need to be changed) you should even be happier. Failed tests are as useful as successful ones. They allow you to get rid of possible scenarios that now you know for sure wouldn’t work.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTesting1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPABTesting1.jpg?resize=500%2C171" alt="WP ABTesting Service" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8539" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Why the decision to turn WP AB Testing into a dedicated service instead of a fully featured plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>We try to combine the best of both worlds: a WP plug-in on the “client” side that the user can install to define the tests, see the graphics with the results, consolidate the winning alternative,&#8230; all without leaving the WordPress environment (meaning there is no need to learn a new tool) plus an external back-end that takes care of recording and processing all the relevant data to evaluate the performance of the alternatives tested.</p>\n<p>We believe this makes a lot of sense, again both at the technical and business level. On the technical side we lift all the processing load from your own server so that the tests do not slow down your site or interfere with your hosting provider limits. On the business side, because an ongoing relationship is needed to be able to advise you on your best testing strategy (by checking what has worked and what hasn’t worked so far for you), on new tests that we believe could be specially useful for you, etc. </p>\n<p>Don’t forget that A/B Testing is only the means to an end (optimize your conversions) and not the end itself. Our mission is to make sure you bring your site to the next level, not just to provide you with a tool to do all the work on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>How can people be notified and participate in the beta?</strong></p>\n<p>Just go to our <a href="http://wp-abtesting.com/" title="http://wp-abtesting.com/">website</a> and join our <a href="http://wp-abtesting.com/sign-up-for-our-free-beta/" title="http://wp-abtesting.com/sign-up-for-our-free-beta/">mailing list</a> in less than 30 seconds.

Use it to add a post summary to your post. <em>(Note: Your theme will need to support post excerpts in order for this feature to work).</em></li>\n<li><strong>Picasa and Google+ Image Support:</strong> You can now add Picasa/Google+ images from the Android Gallery to posts or pages. Just tap the camera icon in the formatting toolbar then select an image to add it to the post. You&#8217;ll need to be online so that the image can be downloaded. You can also select multiple images in the gallery and share them to the app for quicker posting!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also fixed up a few bugs in this release that improve the reliability of the app.</p>\n<p><span>What&#8217;s next?</span></p>\n<p>We are very close to having a beta release of the new Media Library management and Theme Selection features!

I&#8217;ve reconfigured the <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly" title="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">Podcast page</a> so that folks can chat and listen/watch the show on the website. Thanks to using Google Hangout, the audio quality should be better for everyone participating on the show. I decoded to use the embeddable IRC client via Freenode to power the chatroom as it gives users the chance to use their favorite client, is not powered by flash, and updates in real-time. The only downside is the captcha on the form which I can&#8217;t do anything about but I haven&#8217;t come across any images that were impossible to read. </p>\n<p>This weeks episode will feature an interview with the folks behind WordPress hosting company <a href="http://getflywheel.com/" title="http://getflywheel.com/">Flywheel</a>. We&#8217;ll talk about their beta process, what is it they are trying to accomplish and how their service is different from the large amount of competition that already exists in the managed WP hosting market. If you have any questions you&#8217;d like me to ask, just leave them in the comments and I&#8217;ll add them to my list.</p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;m still unsure of is how I&#8217;m going to continue using the iTunes feed that was hooked up to Talkshoe or if I should start a brand new one from scratch. I need to find out if I can upload MP3 files to a specific iTunes link without needing the file to go through Talkshoe. I may end up using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/">Blubrry PowerPress</a> plugin to automate the process of sending the podcast to iTunes. </p>\n<p>Next Friday there will not be a live show as I&#8217;ll be in Grand Rapids, Michigan for WordCamp. However, I&#8217;m already lining up guests for August 30th and beyond. I&#8217;m looking forward to talking WordPress again. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/HvlU1KguFpY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 17:50:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Survey – How Do You Use The Dashboard?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8440";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/QjrBY23HiVQ/survey-how-do-you-use-the-dashboard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2353:"<p>Amidst all of the conversation taking place on improving the WordPress back-end user interface, there is now a <a title="http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-dashboard-questionnaire" href="http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-dashboard-questionnaire">public survey</a> you are encouraged to participate in that will help determine how people use the dashboard and where improvements need to take place. The survey is only 5 questions long but should provide enough information to determine a direction of travel for improvements. For a moment, let&#8217;s take a look at the proposed dashboard for the Ghost platform.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8456" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TryGhostDashboard.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TryGhostDashboard.jpg?resize=500%2C321" alt="Try Ghost Dashboard" class="size-large wp-image-8456" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Preview Of The Proposed Ghost Dashboard</p></div>\n<p>I think a few people, including myself became enamored over the dashboard concept for Ghost but upon looking at it more closely, it&#8217;s just a bunch of numbers in my face. Hard to judge something I haven&#8217;t been able to play around with but it was nice to see a refreshing take on the entire dashboard concept. In the WordPress Dashboard Survey, I was reminded just how much I don&#8217;t use the Dashboard for anything other than getting at-a-glance information. I also realized that if the  <strong>Right Now</strong> meta box included information from some other dashboard widgets like recent comments, recent drafts, etc, that the Right Now box would be more beneficial to me and provide less widgets to be displayed on the screen at one time. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m opening up the conversation by asking what is it that would make the dashboard super useful for you? There is an intricate balance that needs to be observed on the type and amount of data that is shown to the user before it becomes information overload or just a bunch of numbers in front of the users face. There is also the problem of creating a dashboard that&#8217;s useful to everyone, not just specific use cases of WordPress.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/QjrBY23HiVQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 15:20:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: NextGEN Gallery Creator Publishes Open Letter";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8444";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/8prZ5wa1bCw/nextgen-gallery-creator-publishes-open-letter";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3808:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-14-at-4.46.36-PM.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-14-at-4.46.36-PM.png?resize=300%2C101" alt="NextGen Gallery Logo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8449" /></a>NextGEN Gallery is one of the most popular WordPress plugins in the repository and has been for a long time. The last time I checked, it was closing in on over 8 million downloads. However, the latest release of the plugin has caused grief for many people as evidenced by the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-gallery" title="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-gallery">plugin&#8217;s support forum</a>. This has caused Erick Danzer one of the core developers for the plugin to <a href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/open-letter-to-the-nextgen-community-from-erick-danzer/" title="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/open-letter-to-the-nextgen-community-from-erick-danzer/">publish an open letter to the NextGEN Gallery Community</a> admitting that the latest version has serious issues and they are working day and night to try to resolve them. </p>\n<blockquote><p>I want to start by simply recognizing that, yes, there are many and very serious issues with this update. No doubt about it. We’ve been caught very off guard. Those of you experiencing these problems are entirely justified to feel angry and ask hard questions.</p>\n<p>For us, it’s not a question of not caring. It’s a question of what’s the best way to respond under immense pressure from many directions.</p>\n<p>We are working ourselves to our physical and emotional breaking points trying to respond to users and solve issues as fast as we can because we do care. I’m honestly not kidding about this.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love how Erick and team have grabbed the bull by the horns and are using their blog to control and manage the conversation around their plugin. This open letter reminds me of a post I wrote in 2008 on WeblogToolsCollection.com where I told people to <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/08/24/stop-blaming-the-wordpress-team/" title="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/08/24/stop-blaming-the-wordpress-team/">stop blaming the WordPress Team.</a> It&#8217;s a bit different with NextGEN but the message is the same. As outlined in the letter, the team did everything they could to make sure this was a good release but no matter how well they tested, the results would have never come close to the actual environments used by thousands of plugin users. </p>\n<p>What that open letter really means is that Erick Danzer and the rest of the NextGEN Gallery team are committed to the project and are doing everything they can to turn wrongs into rights. I commend him for publishing the letter and addressing all of the noted concerns in one post. Anytime a company or author of a major plugin or theme uses communication in this way, they should be commended as most of the time, communication is the last thing on their minds. Although it doesn&#8217;t fix the problem, just knowing that the developer feels your pain and acknowledges the problem is enough to calm me down and do anything I can to help the developer fix it as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Erick Danzer is not the plugins creator. It&#8217;s listed as <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/photocrati/" title="http://profiles.wordpress.org/photocrati/">Photocrati</a> on WordPress.org. Photocrati is a growing digital media company helping photographers improve their web presence while leveraging our premium themes, hosting, and plugins for WordPress.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/8prZ5wa1bCw" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 20:58:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: WordPress.com Connect";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42952";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2013/08/wordpress-com-connect/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:780:"<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/introducing-wordpress-com-connect/">launch of WordPress.com Connect</a>.

It served us well, but there were places where embracing a fully native experience offers better performance.  Version 3.7 introduces a new Reader built with 100% native code.

I&#8217;ve been working on both an intranet version of a BP installation, in addition to the new creation of a multisite BP explosion that is quickly becoming a monster all on its own. Share in the results of my hunt! Here are some cool new BuddyPress plugins that you may be able to use in your own installation. Remember that these are fairly new plugins and should be tested on a staging site before going live. Make plenty of backups, especially with the new 3.6 upgrades. <span id="more-8382"></span></p>\n<p><a title="MyCRED" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mycred/" target="_blank">My Cred</a> is an adaptive points management system that lets you award / charge your users for interacting with your WordPress powered website. It reminds me a lot of <a title="CubePoints WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/cubepoints/" target="_blank">CubePoints</a> which has some of the same functionality, but MyCred goes a step further. For me, this was the perfect add-on to encourage people to participate in a community I am building. From unlocking hidden Easter egg content to presenting badges and trophies, MyCred delivers a very nicely integrated solution for participation incentives. In just a few days since implementing, the activity has <strong>TRIPLED</strong> because there is now a structure in place that encourages posts, responses, photo additions and tweeting and liking the site. There are many other features that I have not had the chance to implement yet, so I can&#8217;t wait to see the climb rate from here. Incidentally, this also lets users <strong>PAY</strong> their way into the incentive rewards as well, so this could be a great conduit for giving people the option to get reward items (maybe an ebook) either by site participation or simply by paying for it.</p>\n<p><a title="BBPress Users Stats WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress-users-stats/" target="_blank">BBPress User Stats</a> helps to monitor who is most active on your bbPress forums within BuddyPress. It&#8217;s always important to monitor your levels of engagement. It&#8217;s easy and simple to use. Quite simply it&#8217;s a basic participation panel that shows the number of posts and replies from your user base.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordReplacer.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8434" alt="Word Replacer" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WordReplacer.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Word Replacer Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/word-replacer/" target="_blank">Word Replacer</a> can help to curb unwanted language within your BuddyPress streams, comments or bbPress posts and replies. It simply allows you to set up which unmentionable language you&#8217;d like to filter and will replace that word or obscenity with a word of your choosing. It can work in the other direction as well, where you can do your &#8220;<strong>unnecessary censorship</strong>&#8221; and make non-vulger descriptive words into swear words instead. Beyond acting as a swear filter, this can also replace brand names, products, etc. It can take a specific word and place predetermined links or HTML in its place. It&#8217;s only limited as to how you setup the word filter pool. Additional options allow you to select what types of entries that the plugin will be activated on, i.e. Posts, Pages, bbPress entries, etc. You can also control case sensitivity or use it to pick whole or partial words.</p>\n<p><a title="BP Search Friends" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-searchfriends/" target="_blank">BP Search Friends</a> allows an AJAX based search to find other users within the system. It takes into account a few different fields to populate the search data, such as Friend&#8217;s Display Name, Friend&#8217;s Email or the Friend&#8217;s Username. I always had my BuddyPress and bbPress options so that I would be able to private message, but it never gave me a search option to do so. Now with this plugin I have that option.</p>\n<p>Hope you get some use out of these BuddyPress and bbPress related plugins. It&#8217;s often difficult to find a group that works well together, so I&#8217;m happy to provide this quick plugin &#8220;kit&#8221; to use or try on your next BuddyPress installation.</p>\n<img

I have a handful already but just curious as to what you&#8217;d ask them? </p>\n<p>By the way, there are still tickets available to the event so if you&#8217;re on the fence about it, jump off and go!</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/VQP6-QIyoTc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:15:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: WP.com Gets A Trophy Case – Is WP.org Next?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8390";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/DpzsJFviGuQ/wp-com-gets-a-trophy-case-is-wp-org-next";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3959:"<p>Automattic employee Isaac Keyet published an <a href="https://twitter.com/isaackeyet/status/366975655642013696" title="https://twitter.com/isaackeyet/status/366975655642013696">interesting tweet</a> yesterday that showed off a WordPress.com Trophy case that was custom made. The trophy case displays all of your achievements on WordPress.com and looks like the following. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPTrophyCase.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WPTrophyCase.jpg?resize=300%2C243" alt="WP Trophy Case" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8391" /></a></p>\n<p>I find this to be particularly interesting because I remember Toni Schneider saying in a presentation or in an interview, one in which I can&#8217;t find where he talked about the future of WordPress.com and how they were going to try to gamify certain aspects of the publishing process. Gamify is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">defined by WikiPedia</a> as: &#8220;<em>Gamification is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in a non-game context to engage users and solve problems. Gamification is used in applications and processes to improve user engagement, Return on Investment, data quality, timeliness, and learning.</em>&#8221; <span id="more-8390"></span></p>\n<p>Back in December of 2011, <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/get-instant-feedback-when-you-publish/" title="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/get-instant-feedback-when-you-publish/">WordPress.com introduced</a> the first of possibly many enhancements around the gamification concept to encourage users to generate content. As soon as a post is published, the progress bar changes and each time a person publishes 5 posts, they are rewarded with an inspirational quote and the bar resets. </p>\n<h2>Cool For WordPress.com But What About WordPress.org?</h2>\n<p>I think the concept of having a trophy case showing off achievements is a great idea as well as a motivation factor to continue interacting with WordPress.com. However, I think the opportunities are endless if something like a trophy case was created for the WordPress.org project. Something that shows off badges or rewards for their first patch, their first commit, their first plugin review, so many support forum posts responses, etc. All of this information would then be tied into the WordPress.org profile which would really showcase the user&#8217;s activity across the project. I reached out to Otto of <a href="http://ottopress.com/" title="http://ottopress.com/">Ottopress.com</a> to see not only if this idea has been discussed before, but if some day it could become a reality. Here&#8217;s what he had to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve thought about adding badges to the profiles pages for quite sometime, but that&#8217;s one of those things where we need to get profiles themselves working better and collecting more data from all-the-things first. Eventually we&#8217;ll have something like that though. I want to be able to collect enough data to have badges for things like &#8220;attended WordCamp&#8221; and so on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading a Wired magazine article a few years ago that discussed the topic of everything in life being a game. Add a gaming concept to something and you magically have more engagement to try to earn badges as well as rewards that are meaningless to just about everyone other than the person that earned them. We&#8217;ve seen this work with FourSquare, Reddit, and other popular sites that have a lot of community interaction. I think it would be natural to see the gaming concept be part of the WordPress.org project. It would add a little more fun and spice to the act of contributing. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/DpzsJFviGuQ" height="1" width="1"

For starters, the WordPress community is finally getting the chance to reshape the direction of the User Interface. That&#8217;s not to say that developers couldn&#8217;t do that before but by using the P2 site, the commenting section along with being its own separate team, it just seems more inviting to participate versus everything transpiring on core and trac. Also, as far as I can tell,<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/" title="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/"> WordPress 2.7 &#8220;Coltrane&#8221;</a> was the last time the post writing/editing panel received any attention.</p>\n<p>The post writing screen is my home away from home. It&#8217;s where I spend the majority of my day writing, editing, and managing content. WordPress 2.7 was neat because it added widget functionality all across the board from the dashboard to the post writing screen. Just drag and drop boxes, arranging them in the places that made the most sense for my workflow. I&#8217;m a huge fan of things being modular but the more time I spend within the <strong>Add New Post</strong> screen, the more I want to see widgets disappear and have everything be either 0 or 1 click away. I use a 20 inch monitor and I&#8217;m wearing out my scroll wheel to view the categories widget in the sidebar or one of the widgets I have below the editor. This had me thinking about whether anyone had developed a plugin or alternative editing interface that combined the most used widgets into tabs. For example, the editor already has the <strong>Visual</strong> and <strong>Text</strong> tabs. How hard would it be to add the <strong>Categories</strong> as well as the <strong>Tags</strong> widgets as tabs? I thought it would be a good idea but then I came across the proposed editor by Mel Choyce and hers is so much better than I imagined. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TagsAndCategories.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TagsAndCategories.jpg?resize=463%2C42" alt="TagsAndCategories" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8386" /></a></p>\n<p>The most exciting change for me in her redesign is placing the Categories and Tags widget to the bottom border of the post editor. No more having to scroll around. They&#8217;re also in a position that matches my work flow. I generally write <strong>Post Title, Content, Tag it, then Categorize it</strong>. Considering those things are at the bottom of the editor, as well as the Publish button, I&#8217;m loving the looks of this interface already. I&#8217;m also a big fan of the publish button having its own spot versus being tied in with a widget or hidden in a box of options. While it&#8217;s being discussed, I would love to see the need for a Visual/Text tab to disappear. Instead, create the best of both worlds. Not sure if split-screen would be the best approach but I&#8217;d like to add code to one side and see the results as they&#8217;ll be seen by the public on the other while being able to use keyboard shortcuts in the live preview area as I can in the visual editor. Unfortunately, I think I&#8217;ll have to use a plugin to achieve this as I&#8217;m pretty sure this won&#8217;t be coming down the pike any time soon.</p>\n<p>As for the content blocks, I&#8217;m not sure I can form an opinion on their use until after I&#8217;ve had a chance to use them in practice. In theory, it sounds like a good idea where each piece of content is a lego block and these content blocks are just other legos you can build on top of one another. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/contentblocks.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/contentblocks.jpg?resize=278%2C359" alt="Content Blocks" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8385" /></a></p>\n<p>The idea to format text after it&#8217;s been highlighted is excellent. The text needs to be highlighted anyways in order to apply formatting so this process enables the formatting bar to get out-of-the-way. Less buttons to see as I&#8217;m writing content. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EditHighlightedText.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EditHighlightedText.jpg?resize=454%2C128" alt="Editing Highlighted Text" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8384" /></a></p>\n<h2>Get Involved:</h2>\n<p>You are highly encouraged to participate in the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/">conversation on the P2 site</a> where these mockups are located.

Tell me and the audience who you are what it is you&#8217;ve been up to lately?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is David Peralty, and I&#8217;m a recovering blogaholic&#8230; The basic summary of who I am, that&#8217;s relevant here, is that I have been using WordPress since 0.72, was a full-time blogger for five years and created a lot of content about WordPress. Some of you might remember me from the WordPress Podcast or WordPress Weekly.<br />\nLately, I have been working for <a title="http://www.rocketgenius.com/" href="http://www.rocketgenius.com/">Rocketgenius</a>, doing this and that for their Gravity Forms project. I&#8217;m currently focused on helping with some basic marketing, tech support and working on a documentation refresh that will also eventually include screencasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you join the WPTavern forum way back in 2009?</strong></p>\n<p>I had already started losing touch with the WordPress community back in 2009. Things were changing in my career that stopped me from having the time to research and keep up to date with what was happening and who the key players were, and I really disliked that change.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been very passionate about WordPress, and when I started reading the content on WPTavern, I was excited. Here was someone who didn&#8217;t have an agenda. You weren&#8217;t trying to promote your own company, or be sensational just to build traffic. The forums quickly became a place where the &#8220;<em>best of the best</em>&#8221; congregated, and while I never really felt like part of that group, I watched everything happening.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the WPTavern community help you progress with WordPress in the past 4 years?</strong></p>\n<p>It kept me in the loop. It gave me a place that I knew I could come back to. I recognized a lot of names, and felt like it was a group of people who might just remember some of the contributions I made to the WordPress world. I didn&#8217;t realize it until I was out of the loop how much I would miss the interactions and community.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long after I joined that I started working for the government and then a private company, both of which were using WordPress, and so having knowledge of powerful plugins and upcoming developments kept me seeming fresh and useful to those organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>When co-hosting WordPress Weekly, you couldn&#8217;t stop reading the ad copy for GravityForms. Tell us the story of how you became a RocketGenius employee.</strong></p>\n<p>In January of 2012, I went to Cuba with my roommate and his friends. The trip was wonderful, and it wasn&#8217;t too expensive. Upon returning to work, I was brought into a meeting with the company I was working for. They let me know that they had made some business mistakes and that they were going to have to cut their staff in half if they were to survive. I was brought on board a year before that to help them with IT, web development and online marketing, but by the time of the meeting, I had optimized all three. For a staff of 30, I was barely kept busy. With a staff of 15, I was no longer needed. Initially, they told me that I had until the fall of 2012 to find a new job, but two weeks later, I was told that April would be my last month.</p>\n<p>Immediately, I was sent into a panic. I e-mailed some people who I knew had strong business connections, as well as some people who ran businesses. I asked if any of them knew of anyone looking to hire. One of those people who I e-mailed was Carl Hancock of Rocketgenius.</p>\n<div id="attachment_8375" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-09-at-2.57.31-PM.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-09-at-2.57.31-PM.png?resize=500%2C302" alt="David Peralty Checking Out Gravity Forms" class="size-large wp-image-8375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Gets His First Look At GravityForms</p></div>\n<p>He asked me to send him my résumé and that he&#8217;d pass it around. I had met Carl at WordCamp Chicago 2009 where I got to demo Gravity Forms for the first time. Since that point, I had become one of their biggest fans, as you know. I wrote about it and mentioned it anywhere I could because I saw Gravity Forms as the first application that was connected to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Carl contacted me back and offered me a job. They weren&#8217;t really looking to hire anyone, but they felt a connection to me, and my skills were enough that I could be useful to their organization. I&#8217;ve been with them for a little over a year now, and I&#8217;m even more of a fan of their product than I was before. Mostly because in working on the support side of things for the majority of the last year, I&#8217;ve learned more about how flexible and powerful it can be. I also have to say that support is rough.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been writing about WordPress far longer than I have. Taking a moment to reflect, what are some of your general observations of the project?</strong></p>\n<p>The race to supporting the least tech savvy user has always been a bit of a complaint of mine. I liked that it required some technical acumen to install, update and manage. I miss the days where I had to find ways to update hundreds of blogs using a bash script and reading through the logs it generated.</p>\n<p>But the project never would have been as successful under my leadership, and so I&#8217;m glad that it didn&#8217;t fall on me. I think that WordPress&#8217; legacy code is currently its biggest potential downfall, and I hope they take the advice of some people smarter than I and look at releasing two branches for a year or two, one that supports legacy code and one that is a more modern rewrite. I know Matt himself would love to be involved in that. Build an application framework instead of trying to extend blogging software that probably still has some backwards compatible code from ten years ago hidden in it.</p>\n<p>Like other pieces of software before them, the &#8220;world&#8221; is now theirs to lose. Some small upstart could become the new popular publishing system in the next 2-5 years if WordPress doesn&#8217;t continue to evolve to meet the needs of consumers, designers and developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Back in the WordPress Weekly days, you were my cynical half. Has that changed at all?</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest, I played it up a bit for the audience. Being the devil&#8217;s advocate meant that we could discuss things in more detail, and try to see things from all sides. I&#8217;ll admit that I still don&#8217;t like every move the project makes, and I have my more cynical moments, but I don&#8217;t think there are many people who are as big of a fan of WordPress as I am and I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has ever submitted a line of code, or used the software. If WordPress had failed, my career would have been and would currently be, entirely different.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"><br /><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9k7bb_wordcamp-chicago-walkaround-short_tech" target="_blank">WordCamp Chicago Walkaround Short</a> <i>by <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/jacobsantos" target="_blank">jacobsantos</a></i></div>\n<p><strong>Will you be attending any WordCamps in the near future?</strong><br />\nI would like to. I am thinking of attending WordCamp Toronto this October. Beyond that, I&#8217;ll probably start looking at the mid 2014 schedule for the eastern seaboard of the U.S. as it starts coming out. Ideally, next year I&#8217;ll try to attend two or three, but I&#8217;m getting married in April 2014, and I want to dedicate my financial resources towards making that a nice event.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything you’d like to say to the general WordPress Community?</strong></p>\n<p>The WordPress community is so vast, and there are so many spectacular people in it, but please try to find and remember the people who helped build the software and community it is today. My biggest hope, since falling into the background, has been to have mattered.

Collections is a beautiful theme that puts all of the focus on the content. I&#8217;m used to seeing themes with a left or right sidebar with widgets in the footer but this theme doesn&#8217;t have those. This theme artfully showcases what&#8217;s possible with using Post Formats. I reached out to The Theme Foundry to see if they could answer a few questions regarding how this theme was conceptualized and built. <span id="more-8360"></span></p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8363" alt="Collections Theme Logo" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme1.jpg?resize=245%2C129" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Who came up with the initial concept for Collections?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> Believe it or not, we&#8217;ve been working on this theme on and off for two years. Back in 2011, when I first saw the <a title="https://www.icloud.com/" href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud website</a>, I wanted to build a theme with big bold elements to represent post formats. I also wanted it to have that real-time &#8220;application like&#8221; feel. I felt combining these two elements would make for a really special theme.</p>\n<p>Around that time, I reached out to <a title="http://veerle.duoh.com/" href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a>. I knew she would be an awesome fit for this project. She&#8217;s an amazing designer with world-class illustration skills. Her unique talent and vision really brought this theme to life.</p>\n<p>We actually started in quite a different direction initially. You can see some of the concepts in the <a title="http://dribbble.com/veerlepieters/projects/35773-The-Theme-Foundry" href="http://dribbble.com/veerlepieters/projects/35773-The-Theme-Foundry">project Veerle posted over on Dribbble</a>. We eventually scrapped the lighter vintage look and went with something darker and bolder. We just didn&#8217;t feel the vintage look was taking it far enough. Scott was instrumental in working with Veerle on the new darker concept, helping her polish the concept into some final mockups.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8364" alt="CollectionsTheme 2" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme2.jpg?resize=500%2C264" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Can you provide more background information into the use of BackboneJS to power the theme versus more traditional methods?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zack:</strong> From the outset, the goal was to give Collections a &#8220;desktop&#8221; application feel. We wanted fast and smooth page transitions. Using traditional techniques of building pages on the server and pushing them to the browser is inherently slow. <a title="http://backbonejs.org/" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> allows you to make a request for JSON data to the server, then render parts of the page using that data along with Javascript templates. This avoids the overhead of loading all of a page&#8217;s assets (e.g., JavaScript files, CSS files, images, etc.), re-painting the page with CSS, and loading boilerplate HTML. You get a nice speed bump with this process.</p>\n<p>Backbone is not the only library or framework that provides this functionality. There are a host of other options out there, including <a title="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax" href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">PJAX</a>, <a title="http://emberjs.com/" href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, and <a title="http://angularjs.org/" href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. So why did we choose Backbone? First of all, Backbone is really flexible. It is a library that lacks a strong opinion. Actually building a theme like this requires mapping a server side application onto a client side application, which we knew would present a number of issues. We wanted a library that would be flexible enough to handle the WordPress requirement, and fortunately, Backbone provided that. Second, because it was included with WordPress 3.5, it is likely that Backbone will become the de facto standard for JavaScript apps within WordPress. By using Backbone, we will benefit from future improvements pushed by WordPress core, as well as benefit from the community that springs up around the technology. In essence, this means that we will be able to build better products for our customers.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, there are no left or right sidebars. Just content with comments. Was that the whole point of this theme or was that a conscious decision not to include those?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> Widgets were never in the plans for this theme. Collections is built for sharing and browsing. It had to be visually stunning and unique. It had to feel like an application, not a website. Making a strong decision like this allowed us to focus on achieving that goal<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Did the decision to yank out the Post Format UI have any consequences on the design of this theme?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scott:</strong> It was a big deal for us when the Post Format UI was pulled out of core. We were timing this theme to take advantage of the new UI, and believed it would be a great example of Post Formats. The sudden lack of a Post Format UI also made things much more difficult from a development standpoint.</p>\n<p>With that being said, it didn&#8217;t impact or change the design at all. We had a strong vision and we&#8217;re determined to make it work with WordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>Are you surprised at all by the large positive reaction to the design of this theme?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> Every time we reviewed Collections as a team, we were struck by it, even after working on it for a long time. If you&#8217;ve been building themes for awhile, you know this sort of thing is rare. You&#8217;re usually sick of looking at a theme by the time you release it. Collections really felt special, but you never know how something will be received. We&#8217;re glad other people in the community feel the same way.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme3.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8365" alt="CollectionTheme3" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CollectionsTheme3.jpg?resize=500%2C339" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>One of the features of this theme is special media handling. What&#8217;s so special about it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zack:</strong> Veerle designed Collections to highlight the content of a post format. Instead of lumping all of the content together, Collections aims to highlight the special post format content (e.g., a video in a video post). To do this, we needed to extract the special post format content from the actual content. We used some of the functions that were removed from WordPress core, and added our own techniques for grabbing the content. These techniques make it easier to display the content in a beautiful way (see the <a title="http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/collections-theme/type/audio/" href="http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/collections-theme/type/audio/">audio post format</a>). We also leveraged the new audio ID3 tag support included in WordPress 3.6. If you upload an audio file with artist, song, and cover image information, that is used to display the audio. We are really excited about this!</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you can hint us to what&#8217;s coming down the pike?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Drew:</strong> I can&#8217;t share anything specific, but we&#8217;re really excited about the Backbone stuff we explored with this theme. We&#8217;d like to continue down that path and see how we can start using these approaches in all our new themes.</p>\n<p>Other than that, we&#8217;re going to stick to our knitting. We&#8217;re focused on taking the time and effort to design and build truly premium quality WordPress themes. We&#8217;ve always valued quality over quantity, and that isn&#8217;t changing anytime soon.</p>\n<h2>Want A Copy Of Collections?</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to The Theme Foundry team for answering my questions.

In a nutshell, Ajax Edit Comments gave registered and anonymous users the opportunity to edit their own comments within a specific amount of time. The idea was inspired by Digg. Despite the vast array of configuration options AEC provided, Ronald has released a new, simplified version of the same plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a>. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8337" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing1.jpg?resize=500%2C186" alt="Simple Comment Editing 1" class="size-large wp-image-8337" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Timer Showing Time Left To Edit Comment</p></div>\n<div id="attachment_8338" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SimpleCommentEditing2.jpg?resize=500%2C347" alt="Simple Comment Editing 2" class="size-large wp-image-8338" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Comment Editing Interface</p></div>\n<p>With Simple Comment Editing, Ronald has taken a new approach with the WordPress mantra of &#8220;<strong>Decisions, not options</strong>&#8220;. That&#8217;s why if you look around the back-end of WordPress for a link to configure the plugin, you won&#8217;t find it. This plugin contains no styles, performs comment editing inline, and defaults to a time limit of 5 minutes. However, for those that want to override some of the defaults, there are filters for that. </p>\n<p>In my initial testing, the plugin performed flawlessly. It&#8217;s much quicker to edit comments inline versus the thickbox popup, it&#8217;s also easier on the eyes. I&#8217;m now torn between using this plugin or the full featured AEC which has some nice features such as <strong>Request Comment Deletion</strong> and a built-in spell checker via <strong>After The Deadline</strong>. While I sometimes hate the decisions, not options line of thinking, it works well in this instance. </p>\n<p>So I renew my plea to all WordPress sites that enable commenting to please enable comment editing for anonymous users via the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/">Simple Comment Editing</a> plugin or by some other means. I know comments should be proof-read before hitting the publish button but that happens less than it should. It&#8217;s incredibly annoying to hit the publish button, find one typo and have no recourse.

were playing a game of Family Feud and they asked the question, What word comes to mind when you hear about WordPress and Spam? I bet Akismet would be the top answer. However, Akismet is not for everyone. There are alternatives and today, I&#8217;m happy to report that one of those alternatives has a <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/">fresh new plugin for WordPress</a> built from the ground up. The service is called <a href="http://mollom.com" title="http://mollom.com">Mollom</a>. Mollom is a service managed by Acquia, a commercial open source software company providing products, services, and technical support for the open source Drupal social publishing system.</p>\n<p>The service works in a similar fashion to Akismet in that it scans messages such as comments and determines one of three things. The message is bad, the message is good or sometimes, Mollom is unsure. When Mollom is unsure of a message, it presents a CAPTCHA to the user and if they pass, the comment gets pushed into the moderation queue, if they fail, the message is automatically deleted. Bryan House of Acquia does a better job of explaining the process. </p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<p>The system is built around the Software As a Service concept meaning you can use it on Drupal, WordPress, and more platforms in the future. However, I think one of the coolest features of Mollom is their <a href="http://mollom.com/moderation" title="http://mollom.com/moderation">Content Moderation Platform</a>. Using their CMP, you can moderate multiple websites on different platforms from a single location. </p>\n<p>While both <a href="http://akismet.com/plans/" title="http://akismet.com/plans/">Akismet</a> and <a href="http://mollom.com/pricing" title="http://mollom.com/pricing">Mollom</a> offer paid/free plans, Mollom&#8217;s plans are a bit more complicated to make sense of because of the additional features their service provides, such as the Content Moderation Platform. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-06-at-4.26.18-PM.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-06-at-4.26.18-PM.png?resize=500%2C95" alt="Mollom Stats" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8329" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to place the WPTavern site on the free Mollom plan and give the service a test run for a week or two. Once the test is over, I&#8217;ll report back my findings. I&#8217;d love to hear from anyone who is either already running Mollom in place of Akismet or will be joining me in testing out the service on their own site. </p>\n<p>By the way, is comment spam synonymous with the colors green, black, and blue?</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q2YEhlp6_V4" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Aug 2013 20:40:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:12:34 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"133940";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:00:48 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130708073815";}', 'no');

I''m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin'' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\n\n...or something like this:\n\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\n\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://ipatent.com/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

Using the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases we exemplify the diversity of the down regulation process, and concentrate on two sorting steps whose molecular details are emerging. These are the Eps15-mediated sorting to clathrin-coated regions of the plasma membrane and the c-Cbl-mediated targeting of receptors to lysosomal degradation. Like in yeast cells, sorting involves not only protein phosphorylation but also conjugation of ubiquitin molecules. The involvement of other molecules is reviewed and recent observations that challenge the negative regulatory role of endocytosis are described. Finally, we discuss the relevance of receptor down regulation to cancer therapy.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying endocytosis and sorting ERbB recptor tryosine kinasis', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'article-1', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:04:26', '2013-07-08 08:04:26', '', 0, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?page_id=223', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In spite of 10- to 1000-fold lower binding affinity to their respective receptors, the viral ligands are mitogenically equivalent or even more potent than their mammalian counterparts. This remarkable enhancement of cell growth is due to attenuation of receptor degradation and ubiquitination, which leads to sustained signal transduction.

However, some ligands are more potent than others, although they bind to the same direct receptor. In addition, signaling by receptor heterodimers is superior to homodimers. We addressed the mechanism underlying these two features of signal tuning by using three ligands: EGF; transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha); and their chimera, denoted E4T, which act on cells singly expressing ErbB-1 as a weak, a strong, and a very strong agonist, respectively. Co-expression of ErbB-2, a developmentally important co-receptor whose expression is frequently elevated in human cancers, specifically potentiated EGF signaling to the level achieved by TGFalpha, an effect that was partially mimicked by ErbB-3. Analysis of the mechanism underlying this trans-potentiation implied that EGF-driven homodimers of ErbB-1 are destined for intracellular degradation, whereas the corresponding heterodimers with ErbB-2 or with ErbB-3, dissociate in the early endosome. As a consequence, in the presence of either co-receptor, ErbB-1 is recycled to the cell surface and its signaling is enhanced. This latter route is followed by TGFalpha-driven homodimers of ErbB-1, and also by E4T-bound receptors, whose signaling is further enhanced by repeated cycles of binding and dissociation from the receptors. We conclude that alternative endocytic routes of homo- and hetero-dimeric receptor complexes may contribute to tuning and diversification of signal transduction.

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2.

It is conceivable that combinatorial receptor interactions diversify signal transduction and confer double regulation, in cis and in trans, of the superior mitogenic activity of the kinase-defective ErbB-3.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf</a>', 'Diversification of Neu differentiation factor and epidermal growth factor signaling by combinatorial receptor interactions.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '260-autosave', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:19:03', '2013-07-07 12:19:03', '', 260, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=262', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory.

More specifically, the 5,700 years since the events of Genesis do not pose a limitation on the age of the universe. This interpretation is supported by a focused examination of passages from Genesis, Psalms and prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Bible and modern science present radically different outlooks on the creation of the earth, and the origins of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Bible appears to state that some 5,700 years ago, the earth, all species of animals and man, were created. Scientific observation suggests that the earth is several billion years old; species on earth evolved over eons of time; and civilizations were extant long before 5,700 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The arguments presented by science, prima facie, appear to be cogent, to the extent that many modern books have been written by religious scientists to prove that the biblical time frame covers a much longer span of time, for example with each of the seven days of Genesis spanning eons of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The present article will present a different view on the events of Genesis, based extensively on the preeminent 12th century commentary, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, Rashi[i].  Further, support for this view will be cited in prayer and a Psalm.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Beginning – "Aw-retz"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Genesis 1:1 “In the Beginning of creating … Land”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first verse of the Bible refers to the creation of “Land”, "Aw-retz" in Hebrew. Land, throughout the Torah refers to a small geographic location, occupied by a group of people sharing common language or ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Land of Canaan”, for example, is an area of land initially occupied by the Canaanites, promised to the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and bequeathed on their descendents. The descendants of the patriarchs were exiled in “Land of Egypt”. The Tigress River is associated with the “Land of Paras”, modern-day Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The word "Aw-retz" in the very first verse that introduces Genesis,  suggests that Genesis is not about creating a universe or even the planet earth, but something different entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Enigma of the Sun and Moon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther support for this understanding that Genesis has nothing to do with the Creation of a universe, is provided by the verse at the end of the first day; “And there was sunset and there was sunrise, one day”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunset and sunrise require man to observe the sun''s position with respect to the earth, a universal definition throughout the Torah, Prophets Writings and Code of Law. In the Code of Jewish Law, for example, laws regarding the onset of the Sabbath are based solely upon sunset observed from the highest point in a given community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day, according to the commentary, the heavenly illuminators were created, but only "fixed" in place until the fourth day[ii]. The literal interpretation of this suggests that sunrise and sunset of days one through three was either non-existent or totally different than the sunset and sunrise of days four through seven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of this profound difference between what was observed on day one, versus what was observed on day four, the Bible invariably refers to sunrise and sunset at the end of each of the seven days of Creation; suggesting that sunset and sunrise on each of the seven days of creation were equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf something as fundamental as sunrise and sunset didn''t change during the seven days of Creation, one could conclude that Creation had nothing to do with forming the sun and earth and that the sun and earth were fully extant, in place, on the first day of creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the use of the words sunrise and sunset, suggests that man whose presence is required for the associated observations, was present on the planet from day one of Creation; suggesting that Creation occurred on a populated world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat then is the creation about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis – The Divine Story of the Exodus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis does not appear to be an account of how, or when, the universe was created, but an account of the miraculous events of the Exodus from Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:3 “And He said, Elokim, let there be light".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentary, as will be explained in more detail below, this verse refers to the creation of the pillar of fire that led the Israelite nation in the desert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Genesis is truly a description of Divine perspective of the holy events surrounding the Exodus should not be surprising as the relationship is specifically noted in the convocation of the wine on the Sabbath; Friday night. The convocation states that the onset of the seventh day of Creation constitutes "a remembrance to the Exodus from Egypt".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnified Creator, Unified Redeemer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:5:”...and there was sunrise, one day”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary notes that the Torah chooses the words “one day” rather than “first day” because the word “one” signifies unity. This Divine unity parallels the Divine unity during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 12:12 “I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night, and I shall strike every firstborn... I the Almighty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revelations of the first day of the Exodus, beginning with death of the first born Egyptians, were performed by the Almighty alone, without angels acting as emissaries of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short span of a article, it is virtually impossible to analyze every aspect of Genesis. However, we will trace the account of the creation of the "illuminators" to provide at least one example of how Genesis may actually be a description of the Divine Investiture and Divine love that lit up the world during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pillar of Fire – The Great Illuminator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:8 “and the Almighty...called the Rekiah, heaven (‘shawma-yim’)".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary cites the word shawmayim (heaven) as being a contraction, inter alia, of the Hebrew words “Fire and water“[iii]. Water is an integral part of the clouds surrounding our plant. Lightning, a product of static electricity generated by cloud movement, is not present in every rain shower. Fire, referring to lightening that is expressed only during certain types rain cloud formation, is not integral to the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary, however, is referring to the Exodus in which the Clouds of Glory lead the Hebrew nation during the Day and the pillar of fire leads the nation by night and later synergistically combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 13:21: “And the Almighty went before them during the day in a Pillar of cloud, to show them the way”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary relates that on the third day of the Exodus[iv], Pharaoh’s spies that accompanied the Hebrew nation thus far, went back to Egypt and informed Pharaoh that the Hebrews has stopped at the edge of the desert at Pi-hahiros and were lost. Concurrent with setting up of the Hebrew camp on the fourth day, the Almighty orders the Clouds of Glory and Pillar of Fire to remain fixed in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 14:5 “and it was told to the king of Egypt that the Holy nation had fled... And He harnessed his chariot and He took his people .." and Pharaoh starts out in pursuit of the Hebrews on the fourth day following the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Four – Fixing the Position of the Illuminators\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:14 “ “Moros”, lights, will be fixed “yehi” in the Rekiah ‘firmament’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary states that in Genesis, the lights were created on the first day, but fixed in place on the fourth day. The moros of Creation correspond to the pillar of fire. The "firmament", "rekiah", which was similarly fixed in place on the fourth day of Creation, corresponds to the Clouds of Glory during the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavens of Fire and Water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 14:19-20”... and the Pillar of clouds traveled from in front of them to behind them. And it went between the Hebrew camp and the Egyptian camp..." along with the Pillar of Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of Pharaoh''s attack, the clouds of Glory and the Pillar of Fire synergistically function together during both day and night. The Clouds create impenetrable darkness in the Egyptian camp and the Pillar of Fire lights up the Hebrew camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous actions of the Pillar of Fire and the Clouds of Glory,  is key to understanding the commentary that "Shawmayim" is a mixture of water and fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, in Genesis, not Exodus, the commentary states that the "shawmayim" functioned to catch the “arrows of the night"[v]. What is generally read as "Chetzi", meaning "half", should apparently be read as "Chaytey", the word "arrow" in the construct form, referring to the "arrows of the night". During the Exodus, the commentary tells us that arrows and catapulted objects were slung on the Hebrew camp by Pharaoh''s camp during the night. Only through the miraculous protection of the Clouds of Glory in combination with the Pillar of Fire, was the Hebrew Nation saved from injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Four, Week Two -- Diphtheria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis 1:14 “And He, Elokim, said there will be (yehi) profane lights, "Moros”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis commandment that the Pillar of Fire must remain stationary over the Hebrew encampment on the fourth day of the Exodus, provides the commentary with another opportunity to equate the Exodus with Genesis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the commentary, the word "yehi" is missing the "v" prefix that designates holiness.[vi]  Most interpretations ignore the inclusion of the word "v''yehi" in the caption of the commentary and suggest that one of the two "v''s" in "Moros" is missing. However, due to the various spellings of "Moros" during Genesis, there is disagreement as to which "v" of the two"v''s" in Moros are missing. The solution appears to be the word "yehi" that earlier included a "v".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA "v" prefix signifies "holiness". The Divine command to the Pillar of Fire to stop in place  should be introduced as “V-Yehi Moros”, “and let there be Holy lights” signifying the great miraculous events related to the Pillar. Instead, the pillar of fire is addressed with the more mundane command, “Yehi Moros”, “let there be profane lights”[vii].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relegation of an outright miracle to the level of the mundane is quite unusual, but related to a specific occurrence; a terrible tragedy that occurred on the fourth day of the next week following the splitting of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExodus 15:23 “And they came to Moros-ah, and they could not drink the waters because they were bitter...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of the week following the splitting of the Red Sea, the Hebrews stopped at a place called “Moros-ah” where the Hebrew nation complained about their thirst. The complaints represent a tremendous breach of faith that become the source for all further complaints and unholy actions throughout the Hebrew sojourn in the desert. The punishment for the complaints at “Moros-ah”, correspondingly were severe, with the Hebrew nation stricken with a plague similar[viii] to diphtheria[ix].  On this basis, the words "yehi Moros" of Genesis are missing the "v" prefix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the commentary makes the case that that[x] “Moros-ah”, the stopover on day eleven following the Exodus is grammatically equivalent to “Moros”[xi], the illuminator fixed in the heavens on the fourth day of Genesis; thereby providing further leads that connect Genesis and Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe actually have another source that the world is not limited to a 5,700 year span that can be explored in this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30,000+ Years of Civilization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsalms 105:8: “He [the Creator] remembers his covenant…to the thousandth generation”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          There were only 26 generations between Genesis and Exodus[xii]. From the creation of higher man in Genesis until the completion of higher man''s sojourn on this planet, there is a maximum allotment of 7,000 years. Assuming that each of the 1,000 generations arises on average every 30 to 50 years[xiii], the history of man stretches some 30,000 to 50,000 years, with only the last 200 or less generations occurring during the final 7,000 year period that begins with the creation of higher man in Genesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commentary[xiv] suggests two answers: A first answer posits that the 1000 generations may have been foreshortened due to the sins of man. This first answer, however, does not spell out that the 1000 generations were shortened specifically by 800 generations or more. If the 1000 generations were shorted by only 10 or even 100 generations, we have at least 700 generations, or about 21,000 to 35,000 unaccounted years during which the Torah was "remembered".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the "shortening" may not refer to the number of generations, but to the lifespan of each generation. This foreshortening  of man''s lifespan to 120 years is specifically stated in the Bible in proximity to the account regarding the generation of Noah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second explanation by the commentary also does little to significantly limit the time span of the 1,000 generations. The commentary states that The Almighty guarded the Bible throughout 1000 generations. This "guarding" could have taken place both prior to and following the bestowal of the Bible at Mount Sinai, stretching about 21,000 plus years prior to the creation of higher man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon the above, it appears that a more primitive humanoid civilization, preceded Genesis. The creation of man during Genesis, appears to be an account of how primitive man was endowed, ex nehilo, with higher intellectual powers, in anticipation of receiving the Bible, and the higher moral code contained therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommemorating the Generations of Man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progression of civilization from primitive man to a single higher man; and from singular higher man present in each generation to a nation of Hebrews gathered at Mount Sinai, is commemorated in the prayer, "Blessed is the one who spoke". The prayer is translates as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who spoke and brought the holy World into being, Blessed is he." \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a reference to the creation of a "Holy World" having the potential to express the Holiness of the Almighty, through adherence to a Holy moral code, the Bible. The elevation of the mundane world to a potentially "Holy World" occurred with the endowment for potential spiritual elevation in a physical plot of land, the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who spoke during holy procreation (oseh)".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to actuate this holiness, the Almighty created a "Holy Man", Adam, the first higher man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word "oseh", as noted above, refers to procreation and, specifically, the procreation of the first higher man that included Divine manifestation through creating a holy vessel in DNA[xv], the transcript of Holy Man''s intellectual faculties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who decreed and followed through",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above stanza recounts how Adam failed to live up to the Divine commandments against eating of the fruit of the "Tree of Good and Evil", forcing the Almighty to mete out the required punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"Blessed is the one who made Genesis".      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stanza above cannot be referring to the creation of higher man, Adam, which has already been commemorated above. The stanza commemorates the endowment of higher souls to the Israelite nation during the Exodus, an event integrally related to Genesis as noted in relation to the Sabbath convocation above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prayer, "Blessed is the one who spoke", then, commemorates the elevation of a mundane world with the Divine manifestation in the Holy Land, prior to the creation of Adam. This elevation of the Holy Land, however was only a potential that could not be actualized until Holy Adam was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the creation of Holy Adam and his downfall, the actualization of the Holiness of the Land promised to our forefathers was delayed until the true "Genesis", creation of a holy nation, following the Exodus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2,488 Years To Higher Man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the above understanding, the Bible accounts for only 2,488 years of the history of higher man and have little to do with the birth of the universe eons before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis understanding is actually quite logical when one considers that the purpose of creating the world had nothing to do with the Big Bang, the rise of lower species, the appearance of primates or primitive man; all of which were probably "ho hum" events when viewed against the backdrop of our infinitely Holy and Unfathomably Intelligent Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is confirmed by the statement that the purpose of creating higher man world was to create a holy dwelling place in the lower worlds; the lower worlds representing the balance of the world outside the boundaries of the Bible, and its associated immorality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Almighty, infinite and completely unbound by time, the billions of years prior to the Exodus, took no longer than the blink of a human eye. The billions of years during which the earth passed through eons of speciation have no significance to the Divine plan for the world and the universe. the only event of significance occurs in the last 7,000 years of world with the appearance of higher man and bestowal of free choice and higher reasoning does this mundane world, indeed this mundane universe, have the potential to be elevated to a new plane of holiness; a holiness that should be soon be revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only with the Exodus, and the many associated miracles manifest with Divine love as recounted in the deep involvement of the Almighty in Genesis, does the Bible truly begin. Further, the true revelation of holiness will only culminate in the Messianic era upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupernal Holiness, Then, and In the Future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenesis is a Divine perspective of how the vast power of the Almighty was lovingly concentrated in creating changes with the potential to elevate higher man, the Holy Land, the planet and the universe. Exodus  exquisitely records man''s perspective of the actual events that occur in preparation for receiving a new Moral framework for living in the Holy Land and throughout the world as a preparation to greeting the true and all encompassing Messianic Era, led by our righteous redeemer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the space allotted by a article, and Rabbinic interdiction, have curtailed a more in depth analysis of the Creation, it is hoped that this brief article will aid Jews and Gentiles in strengthening adherence to their respective Divine Codes and Obligations – the 613 Codes and the Noahite Guidelines, respectively – as presented in the Bible, the greatest moral and spiritual work of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[i] Rashi Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki, known as Rashi, February 22, 1040 – July 17, 1105, who wrote the first and foremost comprehensive commentary on the Hebrew Bible and Talmud.\r\n\r\n[ii] See Rashi Genesis 1:14\r\n\r\n[iii] This is not a reference to rain clouds and lightning. Lightning may be produced together with rain but lightning does not have the same source as rain, nor is it a blessing.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

Introduction \n\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\n\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\n\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\n\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \nsubject.\n\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\n\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \n2.1.1. Rome Convention \nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\n\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\n\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\n\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\n\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\n\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \n\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\n\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\n\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\n\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \n2.2.1. Council of Europe \nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\n\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\n\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\n\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\n\n2.2.2. European Union \nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\n\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\n\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\n\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\n\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\n\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\n\n3.1 Scope of Protection \nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\n\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\n\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\n\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\n\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\n\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\n\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\n\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\n\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\n\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \nbased on a broader notion.\n\n\n\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\n\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\n\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\n\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\n\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\n\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\n\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\n\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \n“webcasting” would not be needed.\n\n3.2 Substance of Protection \nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\n\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\n\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\n\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\n\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \nfor Information Law (IViR). \n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\nHtml/034.htm </a>\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\nHtml/153.htm</a> \n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary.

Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute.

Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

(341, 1, '2013-07-07 12:42:52', '2013-07-07 12:42:52', 'Universal Inheritable Barcodes for Identifying Organisms\r\nJonathan Gressel and Gal Ehrlich \r\nTrends in Plant Science 2002, 7:542-544\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThe needs for recognition of novel conventional or transgenic organisms include protection of patented or Identity Preserved lines, detecting transgenics and tracing dispersal. We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system.

Co-expression of ErbB-2, a developmentally important co-receptor whose expression is frequently elevated in human cancers, specifically potentiated EGF signaling to the level achieved by TGFalpha, an effect that was partially mimicked by ErbB-3. Analysis of the mechanism underlying this trans-potentiation implied that EGF-driven homodimers of ErbB-1 are destined for intracellular degradation, whereas the corresponding heterodimers with ErbB-2 or with ErbB-3, dissociate in the early endosome. As a consequence, in the presence of either co-receptor, ErbB-1 is recycled to the cell surface and its signaling is enhanced. This latter route is followed by TGFalpha-driven homodimers of ErbB-1, and also by E4T-bound receptors, whose signaling is further enhanced by repeated cycles of binding and dissociation from the receptors. We conclude that alternative endocytic routes of homo- and hetero-dimeric receptor complexes may contribute to tuning and diversification of signal transduction. In addition, the ability of ErbB-2 to shunt ligand-activated receptors to recycling may explain, in part, its oncogenic\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf</a>\r\n', 'Differential endocytic routing of homo- and hetero-dimeric ErbB tyrosine kinases confers signaling superiority to receptor heterodimers.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '256-revision-4', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:38:59', '2013-07-07 13:38:59', '', 256, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=347', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Unlike ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of ErbB-3 is catalytically impaired.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

E2020, marketed as Aricept®, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range.\r\n\r\nResults: Our experimental structure of the E2020–TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the ‘oxyanion hole’, but only indirectly via solvent molecules.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&searchtype=a">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&searchtype=a</a>', 'Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 ( Aricept ® ):', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '263-revision-2', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:20:38', '2013-07-07 12:20:38', '', 263, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=355', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Paradoxically, the neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 is devoid of catalytic activity, but its heterodimerization with other ErbBs, particularly the ligand-less ErbB-2 oncoprotein of carcinomas, reconstitutes superior mitogenic and transforming activities. To understand the underlying mechanism we constructed a chimeric EGF-receptor (ErbB-1) whose autophosphorylation C-terminal domain was replaced by the corresponding portion of ErbB-3. Consistent with the possibility that this domain recruits a relatively potent signaling pathway(s), the mitogenic signals generated by the recombinant fusion protein were superior to those generated by ErbB-1 homodimers and comparable to the proliferative activity of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, the chimeric receptor recruited an ErbB-3-specific repertoire of signaling proteins, including Shc and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but excluding the ErbB-1-specific substrate, phospholipase Cgamma1. Unlike ErbB-1, which is destined to lysosomal degradation through a mechanism that includes recruitment of c-Cbl and receptor poly-ubiquitination, the C-terminal tail of ErbB-3 shunted the chimeric protein to the ErbB-3-characteristic recycling pathway. These observations attribute the mitogenic superiority of ErbB-3 to its C-terminal tail and imply that the flanking kinase domain has lost catalytic activity in order to restrain the relatively potent signaling capability of the C-terminus.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf</a>\r\n', 'The C-terminus of the kinase-defective neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 confers mitogenic superiority and dictates endocytic routing.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '247-revision-3', '', '', '2013-07-07 12:12:57', '2013-07-07 12:12:57', '', 247, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=356', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings.  (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes  [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to <400 bp. Detection can be hampered by a lack of availability of DNA reference material and of sequence information [7–11].\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural''  bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample. \r\n\r\nFig. 1. \r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\n\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\n\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\n\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\n\nFig. 1.\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\n\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\n\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\n\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\n\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\n\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\n\nRegulation\n\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\n\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

Unlike ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of ErbB-3 is catalytically impaired. By using interleukin-3-dependent cells that ectopically express the three ErbB proteins or their combinations, we found that ErbB-3 is devoid of any biological activity but both ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 can reconstitute its extremely potent mitogenic activity. Transactivation of ErbB-3 correlates with heterodimer formation and is reflected in receptor phosphorylation and the transregulation of ligand affinity. Inter-receptor interactions enable graded proliferative and survival signals: heterodimers are more potent than homodimers, and ErbB-3-containing complexes, especially the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer, are more active than ErbB-1 complexes. Nevertheless, ErbB-1 signaling displays dominance over ErbB-3 when the two receptors are coexpressed. Although all receptor combinations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and c-Jun kinase, they differ in their rate of endocytosis and in coupling to intervening signaling proteins. It is conceivable that combinatorial receptor interactions diversify signal transduction and confer double regulation, in cis and in trans, of the superior mitogenic activity of the kinase-defective ErbB-3.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf</a>', 'Diversification of Neu differentiation factor and epidermal growth factor signaling by combinatorial receptor interactions.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '260-revision-3', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:39:26', '2013-07-07 13:39:26', '', 260, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=403', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2. The observed superior ability of ErbB-2 to form heterodimers, in conjunction with its uniquely high basal tyrosine kinase activity, may explain why ErbB-2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf</a>', 'A hierarchical network of interreceptor interactions determines signal transduction by Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin and epidermal growth factor.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '258-revision-15', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:37:15', '2013-07-07 13:37:15', '', 258, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=404', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Here we report that the growth factors of Shope fibroma virus, Myxoma virus and vaccinia virus (SFGF, MGF and VGF) display unique patterns of specificity to ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases; whereas SFGF is a broad-specificity ligand, VGF binds primarily to ErbB-1 homodimers, and the exclusive receptor for MGF is a heterodimer comprised of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. In spite of 10- to 1000-fold lower binding affinity to their respective receptors, the viral ligands are mitogenically equivalent or even more potent than their mammalian counterparts. This remarkable enhancement of cell growth is due to attenuation of receptor degradation and ubiquitination, which leads to sustained signal transduction.

We report that ligand-induced degradation of internalized ErbB-1, but not ErbB-3, is mediated by transient mobilization of a minor fraction of c-Cbl into ErbB-1-containing endosomes. This recruitment depends on the receptor’s tyrosine kinase activity and an intact carboxy-terminal region. The alternative fate is recycling of internalized ErbBs to the cell surface. Cbl-mediated receptor sorting involves covalent attachment of ubiquitin molecules, and subsequent lysosomal and proteasomal degradation. The oncogenic viral form of Cbl inhibits down-regulation by shunting endocytosed receptors to the recycling pathway.

Paradoxically, the neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 is devoid of catalytic activity, but its heterodimerization with other ErbBs, particularly the ligand-less ErbB-2 oncoprotein of carcinomas, reconstitutes superior mitogenic and transforming activities. To understand the underlying mechanism we constructed a chimeric EGF-receptor (ErbB-1) whose autophosphorylation C-terminal domain was replaced by the corresponding portion of ErbB-3. Consistent with the possibility that this domain recruits a relatively potent signaling pathway(s), the mitogenic signals generated by the recombinant fusion protein were superior to those generated by ErbB-1 homodimers and comparable to the proliferative activity of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, the chimeric receptor recruited an ErbB-3-specific repertoire of signaling proteins, including Shc and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but excluding the ErbB-1-specific substrate, phospholipase Cgamma1. Unlike ErbB-1, which is destined to lysosomal degradation through a mechanism that includes recruitment of c-Cbl and receptor poly-ubiquitination, the C-terminal tail of ErbB-3 shunted the chimeric protein to the ErbB-3-characteristic recycling pathway. These observations attribute the mitogenic superiority of ErbB-3 to its C-terminal tail and imply that the flanking kinase domain has lost catalytic activity in order to restrain the relatively potent signaling capability of the C-terminus.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171415/pdf/003348.pdf</a>\r\n', 'The C-terminus of the kinase-defective neuregulin receptor ErbB-3 confers mitogenic superiority and dictates endocytic routing.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '247-revision-4', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:45:10', '2013-07-07 13:45:10', '', 247, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=407', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(456, 1, '2013-07-08 08:00:53', '2013-07-08 08:00:53', 'Universal Inheritable Barcodes for Identifying Organisms\r\nJonathan Gressel and Gal Ehrlich\r\nTrends in Plant Science 2002, 7:542-544\r\n\r\n<strong>Abstract</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe needs for recognition of novel conventional or transgenic organisms include protection of patented or Identity Preserved lines, detecting transgenics and tracing dispersal. We propose simple ''Biobarcodes'' using universal PCR primers to recognize the universal ''nonsense'' recognition site of all biobarcodes, followed by a variable nonsense sequence. The proposed sequences are long enough to allow recognition in spite of mutations, have stop codons to prevent coding, and will not self anneal. Sequences of PCR-amplified biobarcodes can be compared to a universal database.\r\n\r\nThese are a variety of needs for devising simpler recognition methods for organisms marketed in commerce or released in the environment; whether they are conventionally selected, mutant or transgenic bacteria, fungi, plants or animals. The needs include: (1) the need for protection for patented or other IP lines, where IP takes on the designation of either ''Intellectual Property'' or ''Identity Preserved''. It is often hard to prove that a line has been ''miss-appropriated'' by a competitor or illegally grown. (2) Labeling regulatory authorities and various consumer groups are demanding labeling of transgenic commodities. This is accomplished by segregating plants or their products and externally following them throughout their commercial life. Internal markers are an adjunct to such external markings. (3) The need to trace organisms in the environment. The use of biocontrol agents to control weed, bacterial, fungal or insect pests and the use of other live organisms as inoculants is increasing. Knowledge about their dispersal in plants and other organisms as well as in the environment is necessary, irrespective of whether the organisms are indigenous or transgenic. Many of the agents are closely related to known pathogens or pests and there are claims that an organism can change its host range and attack valuable species (with consequences of liability). There are also fears that organisms will introgress into other organisms, and there are needs to ascertain whether the new organism changed host range or whether an epidemic was the result of wild strains [1]. These issues will become more acute with transgenically enhanced biocontrol agents [2]. This can still be a problem even if failsafe mechanisms are transformed into biocontrol agents along with hypervirulence genes [3]. Labeling biocontrol agents with selectable markers (such as gus, gfp or antibiotic resistance) has been used for following the movement of biocontrol agents in the environment [4,5] , but will not differentiate between them if the same few markers are continually used. RFLP has been used to follow and differentiate between one organism and closely related strains of the same pathogen [6].\r\n\r\nThere has been a considerable expenditure on identifying valuable organisms – transgenic and non-transgenic. Seed companies use AFLP and other molecular techniques to ascertain whether competitors have incorporated their genetic material, and the seed industry uses it to ascertain whether farmers have been storing and reusing transgenic seed off license. Consumer advocacy groups and regulators have been using similar techniques to ascertain whether transgenic products have been mixed with non-transgenic organisms. PCR amplification of the DNA in question, using a series of primers for typically used promoters, terminators, marker genes and the genes of importance, is often used to find trace amounts of transgenes in crops and commodities [7–11] . Some processed products might need tens of PCR reactions because of the mixing of crops and the numbers of possible transgenes that they might contain. This problem will be exacerbated as more transgenic crops and organisms reach the market. The multiple sampling and PCR reactions are time consuming and fraught with problems. For example, the commonly used 35S promoter can be found in almost any non-transgenic commodity containing DNA from a cole (Brassica) crop because a proportion of such crops is invariably infected by the ubiquitous cauliflower mosaic virus, the source of that promoter. The PCR results must be further verified by using either restriction endonucleases, Southern blotting or direct sequencing, or using nested PCR or quantitative competitive PCR reactions. Highly processed foods have their DNA fragmented to\r\n\r\nImmunodiagnostic methods have been developed for many of the gene products. Again, each sample would have to be reacted with a series of antibodies when there is a possibility of many different gene products. Even one product can be hard to detect when a single mutation is introduced into a commonly occurring plant gene, such as those encoding many herbicide resistances. It was easier to develop an immunoassay to detect bacterial 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase encoding resistance to the herbicide glyphosate that could distinguish it from the susceptible plant enzyme [12]. Even then, a triple sandwich technique was required.\r\n\r\nEven when transgenics are discovered by such procedures or ''kits'', there is no information as to source. Thus, regulatory authorities might wish to consider simple, common recognition sequences for detecting transgenic or other organisms in the market place. It is depressing to contemplate how much is being invested in detecting transgenic DNA in commodities (and no one has died from eating it) against how little is being expended towards detecting commonly occurring ''natural'' bacterial contamination and mycotoxins in foodstuffs (which have negatively affected many lives). We propose a new recognition system, which, if imposed, would require far less expenditure in detecting DNA, allowing resources to be used for detecting truly dangerous contaminants in foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBarcodes and biobarcodes\r\n\r\nThe barcode system was developed to identify individuals rapidly, whether articles in a store, automobiles or test tubes. A simple barcode reader first identifies that there is a barcode to be read, and in what orientation, by seeing a pattern of bars that is otherwise too rare to be expected randomly. It does so by recognizing a universal sequence of spaced bars in an orientation-dependent manner that appear as universal recognition sites on either end of the barcode ( Fig. 1a). In between the universal recognition sites is a variable series of bars of differing width and spacing. This assigned variable region is read by the reader into a computer and the database then identifies the object as being someone''s car, candy bar or blood sample.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n(a) A standard barcode with universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a variable sequence of bars of various widths and spacing that can be accessed from a database. (b) A schematic representation of a Biobarcode with fixed universal nonsense DNA sequences defining universal recognition sites at either end defining orientation, and a unique defined variable nonsense DNA sequence that can be accessed from a database containing a stop codon (purple) to prevent frameshifts from defining peptide coding. A special assigned sequence can be added for those groups that are interested in having further definition of typed products. Abbreviations: L, left; R, right.\r\n\r\nAn analogous DNA-encoded system with universal recognition sites binding a variable region is proposed akin to the barcode system. This biobarcode system would enable material to be assayed in one PCR-sequencing run using universal primers that identify all ''biobarcoded'' biological materials. In this system, open codes are to be designed and assigned by a single repository. They begin and end with the common universal ''barcode analogous'' orientation-dependent nucleotide sequences that are recognized by the pair of universal recognition PCR primers, which, under PCR conditions, duplicate the whole intervening sequence ( Fig. 1b). The assigned code is transformed into the target organism, as part of a transgenic construct, or it can be transformed directly into an otherwise non-transgenic organism.\r\n\r\nThe universal ''bar code recognition'' nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence is designed to be long enough that a few mutational changes will still allow it to be recognized by a PCR primer set. The initial universal recognition code is followed by a designed nonsense (non-coding) nucleotide sequence that is long enough to allow tens of millions of different such sequences to be generated, and again allow for some mutational changes. Neither the initial common recognition sequence, nor the particular individual strain sequence, should even vaguely resemble nonsense sequences reported in any sequence database. Frame-shift mutations should not render any part of the barcode sequence as an open reading frame long enough to allow significant polypeptides to be made. Stop codons are thus inserted into the assigned sequences in all reading frames to prevent a frame-shift mutation from becoming a genetic coding sequence.\r\n\r\nSome people might not care whether there is any biobarcode in an organism, just whether their propriety DNA is found in it. Such people could have a special sequence pair assigned to them that would follow the universal recognition sequence in a biobarcode. Thus, they could use a primer that recognizes this sequence, and start the PCR reaction from there. Others wishing to know whose and what DNA is in the same organism or sample can probe with the universal primer pair.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of computational power with appropriate algorithms is needed to generate the common universal code sequence and the following variable individual strain sequence. The algorithms used to generate the sequences are being designed to exclude sequences that could self anneal, preventing the taq polymerase from amplifying the biobarcoded DNA. The biobarcode can be inserted in tandem with the genes of choice for transformation, or it can be co-transformed with the gene of choice in cases where the organism is transformed with a ''sense'' transformation. In other cases, an excisable selectable marker will be needed.\r\n\r\nIf a product contains more than one biobarcode (i.e. a foodstuff concocted from different transgenic crops bearing different transgenes), there will be more than one band on the PCR gel to be sequenced. The sequenced bands are then compared to the public database. This is a positive method, with results from all biobarcode-labeled species, versus the guessing at what transgenes might be present, as occurs using the present technologies.\r\n\r\nRegulation\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that a single body would assign the biobarcodes and maintain a public database listing the biobarcode sequences of organisms that have been released. It is clearly advantageous to industry, regulators and taxpayers that such a system be instituted because of the amount of resources saved and the protection provided. Because of the savings, it is in the public interest that such a system be universally instituted.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, for example, the insertion of a biobarcode would probably not come under regulatory scrutiny if biobarcodes are introduced into plants because they are not considered to be ''plants with novel traits'' if they are non-protein producing. In Europe, any introduced sequence (except antisense) seems to come under regulatory scrutiny, but after due risk assessment it is hoped that a blanket approval could be obtained for biobarcodes that meet the specific criteria listed above (and possibly others).\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nUseful discussions with Eithan Rubin of the Weizmann Bioinformatics Group are gratefully acknowledged.

Introduction \r\n\r\nThe history of neighboring rights is a turbulent one. Broadcasting organizations, together with performers and phonogram producers, were for the first time granted legal protection on a worldwide level through the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations of 26 October 1961 (the Rome Convention).1 Although it may have been a first step in the right direction, the text of the Rome Convention soon proved unsatisfactory to all three categories of rights holders, not least because of the subordinate place that neighboring rights seemed to occupy in relation to copyright. The technology-dependent wording of its provisions further ensured that the Convention would lose much significance over the years, as technology evolved. Several international and regional instruments have been adopted since then in order to strengthen the protection of broadcasting organizations and to take account of new technological developments, such as satellite broadcasting, cable distribution, and direct-broadcast satellites.2 Calls for the elimination of the main causes of irritation arising from the Rome Convention are increasingly being heard from the broadcasting organizations, especially since the technological gap between the broadcasting techniques covered by the Convention and the current possibilities has only grown over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe protection of broadcasting organizations has, however, always been surrounded by controversy. Unlike authors’ rights, which reward the author for his creative effort and protect his personality rights, the grant of neighboring rights for broadcast signals merely reflects the acknowledgement of the organizational, technical, and economic effort invested in a program and its broadcast.3 The main rationale of this type of neighboring rights is to protect broadcasting organizations against piracy and unfair competition and, in general, against all acts whereby a third party derives unfair commercial profit from its investment.4 \r\nAnother, more prosaic, explanation for the introduction of neighboring rights for broadcasting organizations is that, with the adoption of the principles of the Rome Convention, the broadcasters became the main source of royalty payments to performing artists and phonogram producers and so, as a form of compensation, they should receive a \r\nneighboring right of their own.5 Some uneasiness towards this category of neighboring rights results from the fact that the regime sets no condition or investment threshold on the broadcasting organizations in order for them to benefit from the protection. Such an unconditional grant of rights is in contrast with every other type of intellectual property regime, where the grant of an exclusive right is predicated on the fulfillment of a condition of originality, novelty, inventiveness, or substantial investment. Other critics point to the fact that this category of neighboring rights is granted irrespective of whether the content of the broadcast is subject to the copyright protection of other rights holders or whether it constitutes material in the public domain.6\r\n\r\nThe question then arises whether the fight against signal piracy or the need to compensate broadcasters for the high licensing fees of performers and phonogram producers constitute sufficient grounds to confer on broadcasting organizations such a strong monopoly on their signals.\r\n\r\nThis article on the protection of broadcasting organizations is divided into two main parts: the first one describes the current state of the protection at the international and European levels; and the second one, examines the protection as currently proposed in the consolidated text of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights.7 The analysis of the present state of the protection of broadcasting organizations will highlight the most important shortcomings of the international instruments on the subject, as well as draw attention to the relatively high level of protection that broadcasting organizations enjoy at the European level. We will thereafter consider some of the issues that are hotly debated within the WIPO Standing Committee and, more specifically, analyze how the proposed changes would compare with the current situation. Finally, we will conclude by making some general remarks on the progress of the Standing Committee towards the adoption of a treaty on the \r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. Current Status of Broadcasting Organizations \r\nAt the international level, the most important instrument remains the Rome Convention of 1961. The Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite signed in Brussels in 1974 was specifically intended to adapt the protection of broadcasting organizations to the new technological development of satellite broadcasting. As we shall see below, apart from the Rome and Brussels Conventions, the regulation of broadcasting rights is further completed at the international level only by the very succinct provisions of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of intellectual Property (TRIPS). At the European level, the Council of Europe has also adopted two instruments and several recommendations dealing with the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. However, these instruments have had a very limited impact in practice. The core of the protection enjoyed by broadcasting organizations in Europe derives from a number of directives adopted by the European Council and the Parliament in the field of copyright and neighboring rights law.\r\n\r\n2.1 Protection at the International Level \r\n2.1.1. Rome Convention \r\nThe Rome Convention protects three categories of beneficiaries with radically diverging interests, namely performers, phonogram producers, and broadcasting organisations.8 This explains why the road towards the adoption of the Convention was a bumpy one and why the final text is, to a large extent, a reflection of significant compromises on the part of the three categories of rights holders. Its completion has been described as a remarkable tribute to the diplomatic talents of those who guided the countervailing forces into a workable solution. Its survival, despite the shortcomings, is almost miraculous.9 The Convention, which is currently binding upon 73 States, has served as a model for most of the existing national provisions on the protection of neighboring rights. With respect to broadcasting organizations, the object of the protection is the programme output, or broadcast \r\nsignal, as opposed to the content of the broadcast, upon which may rest copyright protection that may or may not belong to the broadcasting organisation.10 Article 13 of the Convention provides for a number of minimum rights to “broadcasting organizations” with respect to their “broadcasts”, two terms that are left undefined. As Rumphorst explains, it is the combined effort of the broadcasting organization to plan, produce and/or acquire, schedule and transmit programmes that deserves protection against unauthorized appropriation by third parties.11 “Broadcast” is therefore to be understood as the programme output as assembled and broadcast by or on behalf of the “broadcasting organization”, which in turn may be defined as the organization which engages in this activity.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the protection granted under the Convention lasts at least until the end of a period of twenty years computed from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Since the content of the broadcast is irrelevant, the period of protection must be established with regard to each individual broadcast. Thus, if a broadcasting organization transmitted a given programme in 2000 and repeats the broadcast ten years later, each individual transmission enjoys a separate period of protection of twenty years. The term “broadcasting” is defined at Article 3 (f) as a “transmission by wireless means for the public reception of sound or of images and of sounds”.12 Pursuant to Article 13, broadcasting organizations have the right to authorize or to prohibit the following acts:\r\n\r\n1) The re-broadcasting of their broadcasts; \r\n2) The fixation of their broadcasts; \r\n3) The reproduction of unauthorized fixations; and \r\n4) The communication to the public of their television broadcasts \r\nif such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.13\r\n\r\nClearly, a transmission via cable, or a communication to the public by fixed-service satellite whose signals cannot be directly picked up by the public is excluded from the scope of the definition. The fact that the Rome Convention does not take into account the technological developments that have occurred since its adoption in 1961 undeniably constitutes, from the point of view of broadcasting organizations, the Convention’s main shortcoming.14\r\n\r\n2.1.2. Brussels Satellite Convention \r\nThe Convention on the Distribution of Programme Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite,15 which was adopted in 1974, deals with the protection of satellite transmission by which programmes are transmitted between different broadcasting organizations or between broadcasting organization and cable distributor. According to the provisions of this Convention, Contracting States are required to undertake adequate measures to prevent the distribution on or from their territories of any programme-carrying transmission by any distributor for whom the signal is not intended. In other words, the protection granted under this Convention relates exclusively to the transmissions of signals between broadcasting organizations. Article 3 of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes from the scope of protection “the signals emitted by or on behalf of the originating organization [that] are intended for direct reception from the satellite by the general public”. Arguably, this Convention was negotiated and signed before direct broadcast satellite services had become an economically viable means of exploitation. This exclusion did have as a direct consequence the removal of any practical significance from the Convention. As a result, only 26 States have ratified the Brussels Satellite Convention, in comparison to the 73 Contracting States of the Convention of 1971 for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,16 which was also \r\nintended to supplement the norms laid down in the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\n2.1.3. TRIPS Agreement \r\nThe provision of the TRIPS Agreement on neighboring rights is, once again, the result of a compromise. Like the Rome Convention, it deals with all three traditional categories of beneficiaries of the protection.17 Unlike the solution adopted with regard to Articles 1 to 21 (except 6bis) of the Berne Convention, however, the TRIPS Agreement does not mandate the Contracting Parties to implement the material regulations of the Rome Convention as such. While the TRIPS Agreement reiterates most of the substantial regulations of the Rome Convention and even provides for some supplemental regulations with respect to the rights of performers and phonogram producers, it imposes no obligation on Contracting Parties to confer neighboring rights on broadcasting organizations. Article 14, paragraph 3 of TRIPS provides that: \r\n\r\n“Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).”\r\n\r\nIn other words, as long as a Contracting Party complies with the relevant provisions of the Berne Convention, it does not have to grant special rights to broadcasting organizations. This option was introduced mainly to take account of the fact that, in common law countries, copyright protects not only literary and artistic works, but also all material products which may be reproduced or copied without benefiting from industrial property protection.18 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party chooses to grant protection for broadcast signals, it must meet the minimum standards of Article 13 of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable difference in treatment between performers and phonogram producers, on the one hand, and broadcasting organizations, on the other hand, concerns the term of protection of the respective neighboring rights. Article 14, paragraph 5, of the TRIPS Agreement extends the term of protection offered to performers and phonogram producers from the 20 years provided under the Rome Convention, to a period of protection lasting 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. By contrast, this same provision of the TRIPS Agreement merely confirms the term of protection set by the Rome Convention with respect to broadcasting organizations, protection that lasts for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.\r\n\r\n2.2 Protection at the European Level \r\n2.2.1. Council of Europe \r\nOver the years, the Council of Europe also made a few attempts to regulate the protection of broadcasting organizations. Like all other international instruments in the field of broadcasting rights, those of the Council of Europe have met the same limited success. Adopted in June 1960, the European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT)19 was in fact the first international instrument to provide for neighbouring rights protection for broadcasting organizations. Unlike the Rome Convention, the European Agreement deals exclusively with the protection of broadcasting organizations. In many respects, this Agreement is more modern than the Rome Convention. For example, it grants broadcasters the additional right to authorize or prohibit the diffusion of broadcasting by wire. However, for reasons of technical nature, it now has only a limited number of ratifications, some of which have been accompanied by important reservations, which relate exactly to those provisions that go further than the Rome Convention.20\r\n\r\nThe European Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighboring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention) was opened for signature in May 1994.21 This regional instrument specifically addresses the technical developments, in particular in the field of broadcasting by satellite, which have resulted in the blurring of the technical differences between direct broadcasting satellites and fixed service satellites. Whereas this Convention has a rather broad coverage, including copyright and neighboring rights, it contains only one provision on the rights of broadcasting organizations. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that ‘as far as trans-frontier broadcasting by satellite is concerned, (…) broadcasting organizations from States parties to this Convention shall be protected, as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the Rome Convention’. In essence, the European Satellite Convention adds nothing to the protection afforded to broadcasting organizations under the Rome Convention, whether it is in regard to the scope of the protection or its duration. The European Satellite Convention will enter into force upon ratification by 7 States. Since only two States, Cyprus and Norway, have ratified it so far, only time will tell whether the Convention will ever enter into force.\r\n\r\nBoth instruments are completed by quite a number of Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the subject of copyright and neighboring rights.22 The latest of these Recommendations was adopted in 2002 and deals expressly with the \r\nrights of broadcasting organizations in the digital environment.23 If implemented, the principles laid down in this Recommendation would indeed bring quite significant changes to the current level of protection of the neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. In addition to the rights granted under the Rome Convention, the Recommendation would extend the protection t\r\n1) The right of retransmission of a broadcast by wire or wireless means, whether simultaneous or based on fixations, \r\n2) The right of direct or indirect reproduction of the fixations of broadcasts in any manner or form; \r\n3) The right of making fixations of broadcasts available to the public by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them; and \r\n4) The right of distribution of the fixations and copies of fixations of broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe Recommendation encourages Member States to take measures to ensure that broadcasting organizations enjoy adequate protection against any of the acts referred to above in relation to their pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.24 Member States are also invited under the Recommendation to take adequate measures for the protection of technological measures that are used by broadcasting organizations in connection with the exercise of their neighboring rights, as well as for the protection of rights management information. Finally, the protection would be extended to a period of 50 years from the end of the year in which the broadcast took place. Be that as it may, the Recommendation, as its name indicates, is by nature not a binding legal instrument and we have no indication as to whether or to what extent it has led to any express legislative amendment within the Member States of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\n2.2.2. European Union \r\nIn comparison to the protection afforded at the international level, the protection granted to broadcasting organizations within the European Union is relatively high. The acquis communautaire with respect to the protection of neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations derives for a large part from a number of directives adopted over the past decade in the field of copyright and neighboring rights. For our purpose, the most important directives are the Rental and Lending Rights Directive25 and the InfoSoc Directive.26 In the course of this effort at harmonization, the European Commission has always striven, as much as possible, to bring the protection of neighboring rights up to par with that of copyright law. In effect, such an upgrade in protection has profited not only performers and phonogram producers, but also filmmakers and broadcasting organisations.27 Today, the protection afforded within the European Union far exceeds the norms of the Rome Convention and is almost equivalent to that of Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nPursuant to article 7 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive, broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts. Article 6(2) confers on broadcasting organizations the right to authorize or prohibit the fixation of their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by satellite.28 Paragraph 3 specifies, however, that “a cable distributor shall not have the right provided for in paragraph 2 where it merely retransmits by cable the broadcasts of broadcasting organizations”. This last provision takes account of the opinion of some Member States that it is not appropriate to grant a proper neighboring right for cable distributors that only make simultaneous retransmissions of received broadcasts. Articles 6(2) and article 6(3) would seem to give an indirect definition of the ‘broadcasting organization’, whereby the fixation right is vested in traditional broadcasting organizations, satellite broadcasters, and cable distributors. According to Reinbothe and von Lewinski, this definition applies to the entire Directive, and the fact that Article 8(3)29 refers exclusively to the rebroadcasting by wireless means does not mean that transmission by satellite or by cable is not included.30 The rights conferred under article 8 of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive are modeled after the provisions of the Rome Convention and constitute a minimum level of protection. As article 6 of the Satellite and Cable Retransmission Directive expressly indicates, Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection.31 Finally, Article 9(1) of the Rental and Lending Rights Directive \r\nrequires Member States to grant broadcasting organizations the exclusive right to distribute fixations of their broadcasts, including copies thereof, by sale or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 3(4) of the Directive harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights,32 the rights of broadcasting organizations expire 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite. Contrary to the Rome Convention however, the duration is calculated from the first broadcast only, so that the repeat of a broadcast does not give rise to a separate term of protection.33\r\n\r\nLike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, the InfoSoc Directive is intended to adapt the protection granted to authors and neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, to the digital environment. Among other things, the Directive clarifies that broadcasting organizations have the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.34 The Directive grants an exclusive right to communicate a work to the public only to authors and not to neighboring rightsholders, such as broadcasting organizations, since this right is already provided for under the Rental and Lending Right Directive. Broadcasting organizations enjoy, under the InfoSoc Directive, the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the making available to the public, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.35 Generally speaking, this provision is designed to cover on-demand services over the Internet. It is unclear whether webcasting and other similar types of on-line transmission techniques are protected under the InfoSoc Directive as, although they do not constitute on-demand delivery services, they do constitute a transmission “by wire”. In addition to the creation of new rights, Member States are required to implement the provisions of the InfoSoc Directive with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. Unlike Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe, however, no protection is afforded at Community level with respect to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals.\r\n\r\n3. Issues Raised by the Possible Treaty \r\nSince the adoption of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) of 1996,36 stakeholders and lawmakers have been committed to bringing the international protection of broadcast signals up to par with that of performers and phonogram producers and to adapt it to the digital network environment. The topic of modernisation of the principles of the Rome Convention with respect to the protection of broadcasting organizations has been on the agenda of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights since November 1998. At that time, most delegations agreed on the principle that the existing international framework should be updated and improved and were confident that a new instrument would see the light in 2000-2001.37 Today, more than six years after the launch of the discussion process, the \r\nprotection of broadcasting organizations remains the main topic on the agenda of the Standing Committee and a new instrument has yet to be adopted. Although the Chairman of the Standing Committee recently reported some progress towards a consensus, several important issues still generate intense debate: the object of protection and definitions, beneficiaries of protection and national treatment, rights of broadcasting organizations, obligations on technological measures, application in time and relationship with other treaties. Before the latest meeting of the Standing Committee, held in June 2004, the delegations had once again been invited to submit proposals in treaty language, which have been compiled into a consolidated text.38 Time will tell if and when a new treaty on the protection of broadcasting organizations will be adopted and how far the protection will reach.\r\n\r\nFor now, let us concentrate on two major stumbling blocks encountered during the discussions of the Standing Committee: first, what is the scope of protection foreseen under the possible treaty. In other words, who are the beneficiaries of the protection: should it be granted only to traditional broadcasting entities or should it also extend to datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Second, which new rights should be conferred on broadcasting organizations to allow them to combat piracy? What would be the status of pre-broadcast programme carrying signals?\r\n\r\n3.1 Scope of Protection \r\nWhen the Rome Convention was signed, FM radio barely existed, digital audio broadcasting was hardly imaginable, and satellite and computer networks belonged to the realm of science fiction. Technological developments change the broadcasting market by adding new channels of mass communication. In the current technological environment, a broadcast signal may still originate from a terrestrial transmitter, but it is more likely to be delivered via satellite or via cable. A drastic increase in bandwidth and computer networking further accounts for the emergence of streaming video and audio services, as well as for datacasting, cablecasting, simulcasting or webcasting technologies. The new digital transmission technologies allow the creation and distribution of new kinds of services. This is for instance the case of multi-channel TV, which implies a greater choice of programmes and video-on-demand. Estimates predict that within the next few years, computer networks will allow average home users to listen to music and to watch live shows, movies and series of the same technological quality as today’s TV and Radio broadcasting services.\r\n\r\nThe question arises today of whether these new techniques fall under the definition of a “broadcasting entity” in the sense of a possible international instrument on neighboring rights of broadcasting organizations. Does the expression “broadcasting entity” include datacasters, cablecasters, simulcasters and webcasters? Or should these new categories of “broadcasters” be the subject of a separate definition? Although the definition of what constitute “broadcasting” and a “broadcasting organization” has always been a thorny issue, it has proven particularly difficult throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee. Delegations are indeed strongly divided on the question of webcasting. The elaboration of workable definitions is paramount for the proper determination of the scope of protection of any upcoming treaty on the broadcasters’ rights, as well as to avoid any inconsistency with existing international instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work of the Committee, Governments and the European Community were invited to submit proposals on this issue. Several proposals for a new instrument on the protection of broadcasting organizations have been received by the Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and made available to all participating Delegations. The Secretariat has prepared at different times several documents containing comparisons of the proposals, the latest updated version being dated 15 September 2003 (SCCR/10/3) and prepared for the tenth session of the Standing Committee. The discussions of the Standing Committee from its second session until the tenth session were based on the above-mentioned proposals and facilitated by the comparative documents prepared by the Secretariat. The consolidated text covers all the necessary articles for a new treaty, both substantive provisions and administrative and final clauses. The consolidated text provides a facilitating tool for the Standing Committee, which represents a simplifying step forward from the comparative document referred to above. The function of the consolidated text is to indicate clearly areas where there is a high degree of agreement in substance in the proposals and areas where there are important divergences in the proposals. In areas of agreement single proposals of articles are presented, sometimes in a combined, reorganized or reformulated format. In areas of divergence varying solutions have been presented.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the consolidated text prepared by the Standing Committee39 contains a number of definitions. Among them is the definition of “broadcasting”, which now reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Broadcasting” means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”. Wireless transmission of encrypted signals is “broadcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organization or with its consent. “Broadcasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is inspired from Article 2 of the WPPT, whereby “broadcasting” is confined to transmissions by wireless means. Note that such a definition would diverge from the definition of “broadcasting” as it is presently applied at the European Union level that also includes broadcasts by wire. Contrary to this same provision of the WPPT, which is silent on the issue, Article 2(a) of the consolidated text expressly excludes computer network transmissions from the definition of broadcasting, in such a way that it is reasonable to infer that webcasting or any other use of the Internet to transmit content is excluded from the definition. With respect to the reference to “sounds and images”, the new convoluted wording differentiates “sounds and images” from written text and data, conferring protection only on the first. This distinction could be particularly problematic in the light of digital signals, where the technology allows for the combination of ancillary data as texts, graphics, moving pictures and subtitles alongside the “traditional” image and sound. These additional forms of transmission can be used, for example by webcasters, to provide added value for consumers with the supply of programme related background information, interviews, links, biographies of the ors, different language versions or subtitles etc. At this time, it would seem that such signals are not entitled to any neighboring rights protection under the consolidated text.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with all other international instruments on the subject, the consolidated text provides for a definition of “broadcasting organizations”. In the discussions in the Standing Committee, it was felt that some limits should be set concerning the persons benefiting from the protection of the new Instrument. Not everybody transmitting program-carrying signals shall be regarded as a “broadcasting organization.” The definition proposed in item (b) consists of three main elements: (1) the person shall be a “legal entity”, (2) taking “the initiative” and having “the responsibility,” for “the transmission”, and (3) for “the assembly and scheduling of the content of the transmission.”40 It is suggested that the definition of “broadcasting organization” would be applied mutatis mutandis to the legal entities engaged in cablecasting and, subject to the final scope of the new Instrument, in webcasting.41\r\n\r\nArticle 2(c) of the current version of the consolidated text provides for a separate definition of “cablecasting”, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n““Cablecasting” means the transmission by wire for public reception of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof. Transmission by wire of encrypted signals is “cablecasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to \r\nthe public by the cablecasting organization or with its consent. “Cablecasting” shall not be understood as including transmissions over computer networks;”\r\n\r\nThe definition follows mutatis mutandis the definition of “broadcasting” in item (a), and also in the WPPT. The notion of “cablecasting” is confined to transmissions by wire in line with the proposals of Argentina (using the term “cable distribution”), Egypt, Singapore, and the United States of America. No wireless transmissions, including by satellite, are included in “cablecasting.” In the definition, the interpretative clause referring to encrypted signals is maintained. For the same reason as in the case of the definition of “broadcasting”, “transmissions over computer networks” are excluded from the notion of “cablecasting”. The definition of “cablecasting” is needed if the notion of traditional broadcasting is adopted in the new Instrument as proposed, but would be superfluous if the new Instrument were \r\nbased on a broader notion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed Article 2(d) contains a definition of “retransmission”.42 The term “retransmission” encompasses all forms of retransmission by any means, i.e. by wire or wireless means, including combined means. It covers rebroadcasting, retransmission by wire or cable, and retransmission over computer networks. All proposals contained suggestions on retransmission in narrower or broader form, either in the definitions or in the clauses on rights. In the open-ended form of the definition, “retransmission” covers the substance of all proposals. Language has been added to make it clear that protection should extend to subsequent retransmissions. The definition is confined to simultaneous retransmissions only.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, webcasting currently represents the most contentious issue among the delegations. Webcasting is the delivery of content as real-time and recorded audio and video signals by broadcasting them over the Internet.43 The technology involves the digital compression of audio, video, and text, which is then transmitted without delay. In practice, the streaming software creates a “buffer” in a computer’s RAM memory allowing its user to download video or audio in packets, a few seconds at a time, creating the effect of a continuous flow of transmission. The streaming technology enables suppliers to opt for a few models of transmission over the Internet, among them simulcasting and fixed or on-demand webcasting.44 In fixed web-casting, the schedule and appearance of the webcast is determined in advance without allowing the user to change or control the streamed content. This model, mutatis mutandis, resembles any other form of traditional television or radio broadcasting. On-demand webcasting involves the transmission of compressed audio or video signals most commonly used over the Internet today. This model allows users to fast-forward, rewind, pause, stop, record and replay the event being viewed on their personal user-end device.45 The key feature of on-demand webcasting is the ability of the user to control the scheduling and transmission of the webcast.46 On-demand webcasting is similar to the cablecasters’ “on-demand services”.47 Simulcasting on the Internet involves the transmission of signals that hold an identical representation of images and sound that are broadcast at the same time through traditional television or radio broadcasting media.\r\n\r\nUntil now, broadcasting has always been understood as a transmission intended for “public reception”, whereas webcasting and “video-on-demand” services are sent through computer networks from the server of the content provider directly to the end-user’s device. In “video-on-demand” services, the transmitter streams the requested content directly to the customer’s decoder. One can argue that a particular webcast or “on-emand” service cannot fall within the scope of “broadcasting”, since the transmission is not preformed “for the public”, but rather exclusively for a user who explicitly requested the transmission. In traditional broadcasting, which uses a “point to multi-point” technology, a single process is involved that transfers content from a single origin to multiple consumers. On the other hand, webcasting or “video-on-demand” services are accessible to a group of anonymous individuals. One could argue that a webcast transmission is available for “public reception” and therefore, could be defined as a transmission to the public. It is also a service intended for the public as long as any “member of the public” has at least the opportunity to access the service. Opinions are divided regarding the proper interpretation of “broadcasting”.\r\n\r\nIn this context, delegations have been discussing the need for and possibility of introducing a separate definition of “webcasting” in the text. It is essential to realize that a broad interpretation of the notion of “broadcasting organization” has a direct influence on the scope of application of the treaty. Two alternatives have been included in the consolidated text. Alternative C, which was put forward by the delegation from the United States of America, proposes the inclusion in the text of the following definition of “webcasting”:\r\n\r\n““Webcasting” means the making accessible to the public of transmissions of sounds or of images or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof, by wire or wireless means over a computer network at substantially the same time. Such transmissions, when encrypted, shall be considered as “webcasting” where the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the webcasting organization or with its consent.“\r\n\r\nIn Alternative C, the structure of the definition of “webcasting” follows the definitions of “broadcasting” and “cablecasting”. The operative term of the definition is not “transmission” but “making accessible to the public of transmissions.” This expression implies the modicum of interactivity in today’s technological environment that is necessary to access the streaming of a program-carrying signal. It is the receiver who activates or instigates the transmission over a telecommunications path. The elements “to the public” and “at substantially the same time” serve to limit the definition to accessibility of real-time streaming that may be received by several receivers at the same time. The receiver may log on to the program flow at a given point of time and receive what follows but cannot influence the program flow otherwise. The definition confines the making accessible of transmissions to such activity over computer networks, which by nature may take place by wire or wireless means.\r\n\r\nAlternative D consists in not including any definition of “webcasting” at all in the text. This Alternative recognizes the fact that a great majority of delegations at the debates in the Standing Committee opposed the extension of the protection to webcasts. Many delegations have indicated that further study is needed and have suggested that the issue of webcasting deserves to be dealt with in future discussions and not in the present framework.\r\n\r\nThese two Alternatives on the definition of “webcasting” are completed by those of Article 3 of the consolidated text on the scope of application of the Treaty. According to Article 3(1), the protection granted under this Treaty would apply to the rights of broadcasting organizations in respect of their broadcasts. Article 3(2) states that the provisions of this Treaty would apply mutatis mutandis to the rights of cablecasting organizations in respect of their cablecasts. However, with respect to webcasting entities, three alternatives have been put forward. Alternative E offers the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, the rights of broadcasting organizations to the simultaneous and unchanged webcasting by them of their own broadcasts (“simulcasting”). It corresponds to the proposal of the European Community and its Member States, which was based on the legal techniques of assimilating such simulcasting to broadcasting (“as if it were broadcasting”). Alternative F offers, in line with the proposal of the United States of America, the possibility of extending, by mutatis mutandis application, to webcasting organizations the same protection that will be accorded to broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. Finally, Alternative G recognizes the limited support at this stage of international debate for protection beyond the areas of broadcasting and cablecasting. This alternative would lead to the adoption of Alternative D in Article 2(g), as the definition of \r\n“webcasting” would not be needed.\r\n\r\n3.2 Substance of Protection \r\nThe rights enumerated in the consolidated text of the Standing Committee are very similar to those listed in Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. Despite some minor doctrinal differences, there appears to be general agreement that any new treaty should clearly protect broadcasts transmitted for public reception via wire or wireless means, including by cable or satellite. Some of the rights proposed in the consolidated text48 include rights with respect t\r\na) The retransmission, by any means of their broadcasts (article6); \r\nb) The communication to the public of broadcasts, if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee (article 7); \r\nc) The fixation of their broadcasts (article 8); \r\nd) The direct or indirect reproduction of fixations of broadcasts (article 9); \r\ne) The making available to the public of the original and copies of fixations of their broadcasts, through sale or other transfer of ownership (article 10); \r\nf) The transmission of their broadcasts following fixation of such broadcasts (article 11); and g) The making available to the public of their broadcasts from fixations, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and a time individually chosen by them (article 12).\r\n\r\nWith respect to the right of reproduction of fixations of broadcasts under Article 9 of the consolidated text, two alternatives were put forward. The first alternative confers on broadcasting organizations the exclusive right of authorizing the direct and indirect reproduction, in any manner or form, of fixations of their broadcasts. The second alternative gives broadcasting organizations two distinct rights: (1) the right to prohibit the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; and (2), the right to authorize the reproduction of their broadcasts from fixations made pursuant to the fair use doctrine or other national \r\nlegislation exceptions, when such reproduction would not be permitted by law or otherwise made without their authorization. This second paragraph corresponds to Article 13(c)(i) and (ii) of the Rome Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to article 10 of the text, the United States of America suggested, instead of a right of distribution as worded above, a second alternative: to grant a more restricted right to prohibit the distribution to the public and the importation of reproductions of unauthorized fixations of their broadcasts. Note that this solution, confined to the “outlawing” of bootlegged copies of broadcasts, would derogate from the one adopted by the WPPT and by the European Union.\r\n\r\nApart from the problems raised by webcasting, another long-debated issue within the Standing Committee concerns the protection that should be afforded to pre-broadcast programme carrying signals. Generally speaking, “programme-carrying signal transmission” can be divided into two types: pre-broadcast and post-broadcast transmission. In post-broadcast transmissions, the signals that are transmitted to the public can be perfectly reproduced, whereby perfect digital copies of broadcast programs can easily be copied and offered as Internet downloadable copies that can be redistributed. Transmissions of broadcasts over the Internet are vulnerable to piracy because of the ease with which contents can be accessed and copied. Pre-broadcast signals are signals that are not intended for direct reception by the public. Such signals are used by broadcasting organizations to transfer program material from a studio or e.g. from the site of an event to the place where a transmitter is situated. Such signals may also be used for transfer of program material between broadcasting organizations, as may be used for broadcast after a delay or after some editing of the material.49 They do not constitute “broadcasting”, since they are not intended for the public, but form rather a point-to-point transmission by telecommunications links. Since pre-broadcast signals are often transmitted in digital form, perfect digital copies can be obtained from the programme-carrying signals and copies, and downloads or re-broadcasting can be made. The pre-broadcast signals can be disseminated simultaneously with the official transmissions or even before the scheduled time for those transmissions.\r\n\r\nThe issue of pre-broadcast signals had already been addressed during the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the Brussels Satellite Convention, as a result of which Contracting States were required to undertake adequate measures against unauthorized distribution. However, the question of whether the measures to control this phenomenon should be regulated by public or private law stayed open. After long discussions, Article 13 of the consolidated text now provides that “broadcasting organizations shall enjoy adequate and effective legal protection against any acts referred to in Article 6 to 12 of this Treaty in relation to their signals prior to broadcasting”. The open wording of this provision leaves Contracting Parties the necessary room to decide how best to implement this obligation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn November 2004 the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights will hold its twelfth session dedicated to the elaboration of an instrument on the protection of the rights of broadcasting organizations. Although the agenda for the meeting is not yet available, it is safe to assume that the delegations will attempt to consolidate the common ground achieved so far, with a view to convening a Diplomatic Conference at a later date for the adoption of a treaty on the subject. According to the current version of the consolidated text drawn up by the Standing Committee, the protection afforded by any new treaty would show distinct similarities with the protection actually granted at the European Union level, as well as with Recommendation (2002)7 of the Council of Europe. In addition to creating new rights that are arguably better adapted to the state of technology, the consolidated text would, like the WPPT and the European instruments, contain provisions with respect to the legal protection of technological measures and of rights management information. A new treaty based on this consolidated text would follow the trend established in Europe and increase the duration of protection to 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast, whether this broadcast is transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, instead of the 20 years provided for under the Rome Convention. For the rest, it remains to be seen whether the discussions of the upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee will lead to the adoption of a treaty and whether the protection of such a treaty will extend to webcasters.\r\n\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\n*) Assistant professor, Faculty of Law, University of Amsterdam, and researcher at the Institute \r\nfor Information Law (IViR). \r\n**) Currently Technical Advisor at Ehrlich & Partners - Patent Attorneys,   Ramat-Gan (Israel), ex- law clerk at the law firm Gilat, Bareket & Co., Tel-Aviv (Israel) and a trainee at IViR.\r\n1) Text available at: <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo024en.htm</a> \r\n2) See: European Agreement on the Protection of Television Broadcasts (EAT), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 22 June 1960, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/034.htm ">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/034.htm </a>\r\nConvention Relating to the Distribution of Programme-Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention), signed in Brussels, 21 May 1974, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm ">http://www.wipo.int/clea/docs/en/wo/wo025en.htm </a>\r\nEuropean Convention Relating to Questions on Copyright Law and Neighbouring Rights in the Framework of Transfrontier Broadcasting by Satellite (European Satellite Convention), Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 11 May 1994, text available at: \r\n<a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/ Html/153.htm">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/\r\nHtml/153.htm</a> \r\n3) Natali Helberger, Neighbouring rights protection of broadcasting organisation: Current \r\nproblems and possible lines of action, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 15 November 1999, Doc.

One example is the possible integration of right locker architectures. The article addresses this technology from a legal point of view and analyzes the possible advantages and impediments that might result from the integration of this model.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Right locker architectures, bandwidth, privacy, digital contracts\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe digital content delivery is facing tremendous changes since the advent of the Internet. Those changes are primarily led by the constant expansion of the net bandwidth. Broader bandwidth enables various new web-based applications with different methods to disperse digital content efficiently. Those new possibilities alter the content industry and change the way people use and enjoy consumer electronic products, media, and entertainment. One indication of change in the consumers'' consumptive behaviour is the increasing demand to access digital content from portable devices like laptop, PDA and mobile phone, a tangible manner in the shade of the third generation of wireless services.\r\n\r\nEnabling the user to access digital content either from his home stationary or from his mobile devices raises some challenges regarding the traditional DRM model. In the current technology, users'' digital rights are annexed to the protected content that is fixated in a particular device and can be accessed either directly, or from any other device that stores another private copy of the content. However, the user cannot access the purchased content from any other device, though he already acquired the right to use the content. Rights locker architecture technology presents a model that circumvents this content fixation problem.\r\n\r\nThe "Rights Locker" model\r\nIn this model, the content resides only on the rightholder''s data server memory. The user practically purchases only the right to access the content and not a physical copy of it. The user rights are stored on a server that was configured to hold authorization information. At the moment of purchase, the authorization server updates the user rights and stores them in accordance with the transaction contract.\r\n\r\nWhenever the user desires to access the content, an adjusted application at the user device sends a request to the authorization server. After the server verified the request, the content is streamed to the user from the data server. The same procedure takes place irrespective of the used device, enabling the identified user to access content.\r\n\r\nThis is not a theoretical model. For example, Digital World Services (DWS 2004), a provider of software for secure delivery of digital content, implemented "rights locker" technology in its ADo2RA system, a content independent digital distribution infrastructure, that is designed to enable content providers and retailers to package, protect, and deliver digital content across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nCustomer advantages of "Rights Lockers"\r\nApart from the accessibility, rights locker architecture provides several additional advantages for the customers. The acquired data is backed-up safely, proofed from hardware failures or viruses hazards. Additionally, the user does not have to allocate new memory for the content, and therefore the hardware costs reduce.\r\n\r\nContent supplier''s can now offer new business models, based on access control: Different contracts regarding the same data can suit different customers better then the current prevailing download model by offering variant prices, based on time periods or number of access permissions. The right to access the content can be sold not only to individuals but also to groups of people, reducing the price per capita (i.e. access is bought for a group of employees).\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and uncertainties\r\nThe adoption of the new technology still has to face several impediments. From the technological point of view, the current bandwidth is not sufficient to enable real time streaming in a quality that will satisfy the average customer. It seems that the "rights locker" model will only proliferate when bandwidth will allow streaming of content at the same quality of service known in today''s apparatus (i.e. supplying real time streaming of songs and movies at the same quality as playing them from the memory of the used devise). However, reaching this quality threshold is just a matter of time. According to Edholm''s Law (Cherry 2004), in about five years third-generation wireless will routinely deliver 1 Mb/s, allowing audio streaming directly to mobile phones. Wi-Fi technologies will deliver  10 Mb/s wireless access for PDA and laptops, allowing video and audio streaming simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom the legal point of view, the current European copyright legal frame is phrased in terms of usage, not access. An authorization is needed from the right holder to carry through actions like reproduction, communication to the public and making available to the public. The copyright directive defines the lawful use of the content and the usage exemptions in terms of "private copy" or "fixation of the content". However, full integration of the rights locker architectures means that no physical copy of the content would be stored on the consumer devices. The user will "access" the content subjected to contract stipulations rather then "use" as in the sense of lawful use definitions and exemptions.\r\n\r\nEven though, one can argue that the new technology is just a new way to handle DRM by mobilizing the digital rights rather than confining them to certain data files, with other words: a way to adjust to the new broad wireless bandwidth surrounding. However, if rights locker architectures will be adhered, a re-thinking of existing terms and definitions in copyright law is required: Sharing files with friends is not "space shifting" anymore but sharing access to the same content, Peer-to-Peer phenomena might transpose into password sharing and "private copying" will be subject to the contract terms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the technology facilitates copyright enforcement. Firstly, this is because the supplier can encrypt the transmitted signals, and thereby impede the fixation of the content. The supplier can digitally tag each transmission of the content, enabling easy tracing of the origin of the fixated copy. Thirdly, the content supplier can easily monitor the use of content, regarding the frequency of use and the IP address of the user devices to enforce the purchase contract.\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\nThe integration of "right locker" technology might have substantial implications on the current legal frame and therefore should be examined by copyright legislators. In regard to the access agreements, the contract frame should raise questions regarding access control: can a database owner criminalize a user who stores "private copies" on his hard-drive when the contract terms prohibit this? Can the supplier control the access to the content eternally or is he obligated to enable free access to content after the expiration of the content copyright? And even if the release of the content to the public domain is obliged, what are the incentives for suppliers to enable access for content that is in the public domain. From the customers'' point of view, basic rights should be secured. User''s privacy might be endangered because of the ability of content owners to monitor the central repository server and to document user actions. Dilemmas for possible legislation can be what are the limits of access data compilations? Who should hold the ability to access this information? And what uses of the data is the supplier entitled to? It seems that this problem is inherited in the technology and will require a continuous monitoring mechanism to guard the users'' human rights.\r\n\r\nBottom line\r\nIt is still early to estimate in the light of the current bandwidth potential if rights locker architectures will succeed to enter the content delivery market. The integration of the technology holds great advantages for customers especially by enabling various access possibilities from different devices. However, the impediments and dangers to customers’ privacy should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry, Steven: Edholm''s Law of Bandwidth.

Barish, Adv., B.Sc. in E.E., 1946, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago;\r\n\r\nJ.D., 1950, LL.M. 1951, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n(All opinions expressed herein are those solely of the author)\r\n\r\nA woman went to the market to buy a chicken. She approached a stand covered with a pile of chickens for sale, grasped a chicken, held it up to the light, spread the wings and legs, one way, then the other, and carefully examined, probed and sniffed each part of the chicken, but eventually discarded the chicken and picked up another one for examination. After she had thus examined and discarded a number of chickens, the shopkeeper, witnessing all this with patient silence, could hold back no longer: "Lady", he asked, "could you yourself pass such an examination?"\r\n\r\nHow many of the issued patents in the field of high technology could confidently pass such an examination with respect to the best mode requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, as interpreted by recent court decisions, particularly when the invention relates to a highly technical development, and the patent application was filed just before commerica1 production? A review of recent decisions on this issue, as set forth below, indicates that, at best, the answer to this question is unpredictable, and in many or most cases would be negative because the tests applied are both subjective and unrealistic in today''s high technology world.\r\n\r\nThe Present Situation\r\n\r\nTake the case of a highly technical development for an engine control system that you have been requested to protect by one or more patent applications. The engine control system includes the following main components: (a) a fuel feeding system for feeding fuel to the engine; (b) a plurality of sensors for sensing predetermined conditions in the engine; (c) an electrical processor for processing the outputs of the sensors according to certain algorithms to output control signals; and (d) control devices, such as actuators, valves, etc., for controlling the fuel to the engine in accordance with the output control signals.\r\n\r\nAssume there is novelty in certain aspects of the overall system, as well as in one or more of the above components, so that it may be necessary to file more than one patent application to cover all the novel features. However, only one system has been developed and optimized for production. Each of the above four components involves considerable detailed information including information characterised as manufacturing data, customer requirements, and trade secrets. Such information may include, for example, dimensions, tolerances, materials, heat treatments, performance and design specifications, assembly methods, algorithms of processor operations, commercial name of outside-supplied components, etc. A written description of all such information of the optimized system developed for commercial production would require hundreds or thousands of pages or documents.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such detailed information involved a tremendous investment on the part of the developer. Such information might be, and frequently is, included in a separate "know-how package" if the optimized form of the development is licensed to another for production.\r\n\r\nThe attorney charged with drafting the patent application or applications is first faced with the dilemma of determining exactly what information to include in the patent application to assure compliance with the best mode requirement, as well as the enabling requirement, of 35 USC 112, first paragraph. Since only one mode has been developed and optimized, the safe course of action would be to include in the patent application(s) all the information including the detailed manufacturing data, customer requirements and trade secrets embodied in the many hundreds or thousands of documents, particularly in view of the holding in the leading case on this issue, Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp. 913 F.2d 923 (Fed. Cir.. 1990), at 930:\r\n\r\n"--Whether characterizable as “manufacturing data” “customer requirements,” or even “trade secrets,” information necessary to practice the best mode simply must be disclosed".\r\n\r\nNot only would this be impractical (or perhaps even impossible), but an attorney attempting to do this, in all probability, would be performing a disservice to the client, to the Patent Office, and to the public. Thus, the eventual publication of this valuable know-how information to possible competitors could seriously compromise the client’s investment in developing this information. Including this detailed information in the patent application would require the Patent Office to accommodate this great bulk of material in its files and the Examiner to consider it in the examination for novelty, thereby obscuring the really novel features sought to be patented. It would have little value to the public except to competitors who wished to manufacture the optimized system in all its details. Even then, the value of such information would be very limited since the system, if successfully patented, could not be legally manufactured without license until the patent expires; and by that time, much of the information would probably have become outdated.\r\n\r\nIf anything less than all the technical details, requiring hundreds or thousands of pages or documents involved in the optimized development, is included in the patent application, the attorney runs the risk of omitting something which may later be considered to be a feature of the patented development sufficiently significant to risk the patent being invalidated on the grounds of failure to comply with the best mode requirement.\r\n\r\nIn any event, this requirement, as set forth in the above quotation from the Chemcast decision, effectively invites everyone charged with infringing a patent to conduct an extensive “sniff and probe” examination in an attempt to identify any technical information which was known to the inventor or employer at the time the patent application was filed, which was not disclosed in the patent application, and which had some significant effect on the optimized implementation of the invention, in order to invalidate the patent for failure to comply with the best mode requirment. Even if all the details in these hundreds or thousands of documents are disclosed in the patent, there is still no certainty that the patent will be immune from such attack because of the impossibility of assuring that all relevant information known to all the individuals involved in the optimized development was properly considered or documented, particularly in a sophisticated invention in high technology.\r\n\r\nThe above Chemcast decision applied a two-step analysis for the “best mode requirement”: The first step is to determine whether the inventor, at the time the patent application was filed, knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention considered by the inventor to be better than any other. If the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode, the second step of the analysis is to compare what the inventor knew with what the inventor disclosed, and particularly to determine whether all such information “necessary to practice the best mode” was indeed disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Chemcast two-step test is that it “begs the issue”. \r\nThus, the first inquiry – “whether the inventor in fact contemplated such a preferred mode” – presumably should always be answered in the affirmative since 35 USC 112 requires that the inventor:\r\n\r\n“shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention”.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly conceivable that an inventor can avoid this issue by merely refusing to admit that a best mode was indeed contemplated before the application was filed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are left only with the second inquiry; but this second inquiry merely restates the ultimate issue involved in determining compliance or non-compliance with the best mode requirement, and provides no guidance, except in the all-inclusive statement quoted above, for making this determination.\r\n\r\nSubsequent court decisions have variously applied the above two-step Chemcast test, and/or a "concealment" test, among many other tests. Some cases held that to invalidate the patent "concealment" must be based on knowledge coupled with a specific intent to conceal, whereas other cases held that no specific intent is necessary. However, the problem with using "concealment" as a test is that anything known but not disclosed may be considered as "concealed". Also, since every detail of the manufacturing data included in the hundreds or thousands of documents describing a highly-technical optimized development can be considered as having some affect on the manufacture or operation of the development, a "concealment" test is not only unrealistic, but is highly subjective, depending on the sympathies and inclinations of the decider (judge or jury), and produces unpredictable results. It also encourages one to “sniff and probe” without limitation to locate something that can be argued as concealed.\r\n\r\nThis dilemma presented by recent court decisions regarding the “best mode requirement” is well highlighted in an exhaustive analysis of the current situation by Stephen B. Walmsley; Best Mode: A Plea to Repair or Sacrifice This Broken Requirement of United States Patent Law; Walmsley12-9 Mich.Telecomm.Tech.L. Rev. 125 (2002). In this article, the author traced the evolution of this requirement and discussed the multitude of standards set forth in the cited cases for assessing the disclosure needed to comply with this requirement. The various standards were summarized into the following seven categories: (1) the “claims-only” standard; (2) the “essentiality” standard; (3) the “essentiality and novelty” standard; (4) the “necessity” standard; (5) the “necessary and nonobvious” standard; (6) the “material effect” standard; and (7) the “relation” standard. A diagram was attached (Diagram 2 of the Appendix) setting forth these seven standards, including the cases on which each is based. The article concludes with the following Summary (page 167):\r\n\r\n“The definition of the best mode requirement of U.S. patent law is unclear and the scope unstable. Instability in the scope of the best mode requirement leads to great expenses incurred in over-complying with the statute and to even greater risks in under-complying with the statute. Such unnecessary expenses and risks are a great disservice to the patent system. Therefore, the best mode requirement desperately needs to be stabilized by an en banc ruling of the CAFC. In the alternative, the best mode requirement should be beneficially sacrificed as a bargaining chip during negotiations with other countries in furtherance of international patent law harmonization efforts. In the meantime, however, inventors are advised to disclose everything important enough to have been documented during the project development phase of their invention process.”\r\n\r\nThis dilemma, as to the information to be included by the US practitioner in a patent application in order to meet the best mode requirement, is no less for the foreign practitioner when preparing the first patent application to be filed in the foreign country, since the foreign application must also meet all the requirements of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if it is to support a claim for its priority date under the International Convention.\r\n\r\nClearly, therefore, there is an urgent need for a realistic, objective test for the “best mode requirement”. Before formulating such a test, it is first necessary to consider the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Intent\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of 35 USC 112 provides:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.”\r\n\r\nThe "enabling" requirement in the above-quoted passage appears first and involves primarily a quantitative test, namely sufficient information "to enable" an implementation of invention. The "best mode" requirement follows the "enabling" requirement in the above passage and appears to involve primarily a qualitative test qualifying the "enabling" requirement, namely by specifying the quality or type of mode to be described to meet the "enabling" requirement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed this indeed was the legislative intent in 35 USC 112, first paragraph. That is, it is not believed that the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth all the information that may be involved in the “best mode contemplated by the inventor”, including all the know-how, technical details, etc. Rather, it is believed the legislative intent was that the Applicant set forth enough information (quantitatively speaking) to meet the "enabling requirement", and that such information (qualitatively speaking) relate to "the best mode contemplated" by the inventor at the time the patent application was filed, rather than to an inferior mode. In short, it is believed the legislative intent was:\r\n\r\n(a)    in the enabling requirement, to require that the applicant teach the public sufficient information to enable the practice of the invention (primarily a quantitative test), and\r\n\r\n(b)    in the best mode requirement (which follows the enabling requirement) to require that the information set forth to meet the enabling requirement relate to the best mode, and not to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test).\r\n\r\nWhile issues concerning the "enabling requirement" arose from the start and were resolved without particular difficulty, it was only after Judge Rich''s opinion in In re Nelson (126 USPQ 242, CCPA 1960) that difficult issues began to arise with respect to the best mode requirement, because of the statement:\r\n\r\n“Hence Section 112 calls for description in ''full, clear, concise and exact terms'' and the ''best mode'' requirement does not permit an inventor to disclose only what he knows to be his second-best embodiment, retaining the best for himself”.\r\n\r\nHowever, Judge Rich''s opinion in the Nelson case itself suggests that the "best mode" requirement concerns primarily a qualitative test and not a quantitative test: namely, that the information disclosed to meet the enabling requirement must be directed, not to a second-best embodiment, but rather to the best embodiment known to the inventor at the time the application is filed.\r\n\r\nThe Nelson decision was followed by decisions in other courts applying a “concealment” test. Some decisions required both knowledge and special intent to conceal a best mode in order to invalidate on these grounds (Benger Laboratories. Ltd. v. R.K. Laros Co. 133 USPQ 693, third Cir. 1963); Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Riverton Laboratories, Inc., 167 USPQ 656 (second Cir. 1970); whereas other cases held that specific intent to conceal is not necessary (Dale Electronics. Inc, v. R.C.L. Electronics. Inc. 180 USPQ 225, first Cir. It is believed these cases wrongly applied a primarily "quantitative" test, namely that all the information should be supplied regarding the best mode, rather than what is believed to be primarily a qualitative test in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and in the Nelson case.\r\n\r\nThe "quantitative" test for the best mode requirement was particularly applied in Union Carbide Corp. v. Borq-Water Corp. 193 USPQ 1 (sixth Cir. 1977). This decision involved a patent directed to a process for moulding foamed thermoplastic products, and held that the inventor''s failure to disclose a particular valve and a particular extruder used to perform the process violated the best mode requirement, even through the new valve was the subject of a subsequently filed U.S. patent application. The Court so held despite the fact that the patentee had signed up 54 licensees, each of which had paid for a "know-how package" containing extensive written specifications, including the specially designed extruder.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not believed the legislative intent, in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, was to require the patent application also to include clearly know-how information relating to an optimized form of the best mode of the invention. If this indeed had been the legislative intent, this would have effectively precluded inventors from protecting "know-how" and trade secrets with respect to patented inventions, as always permitted and as now quite common.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant to the issue of the “legislative intent” in 35 USC 112, first paragraph, is the scope of the relevant subject matter required to be described in the specification. Various courts on various occasions have applied many conflicting standards as to the scope of such subject matter, summarized in the above-cited Walmsley article into seven categories. It is believed, however, that the legislative intent with respect to the scope of the relevant subject matter is revealed by the actual words appearing in the first and second paragraphs of 35 USC 112. Thus, the first paragraph states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, …”\r\n\r\nand the second paragraph of 35 USC 112 states:\r\n\r\n“The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention. …”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that when both sentences are properly construed together, the legislative intent in defining the required description of the invention in the first paragraph refers to the invention defined in the claims specified in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nDetermining the legislative intent with respect to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112 should also take into consideration the legislative intent of other provisions of the same statute. For example, 35 USC 181 – 188 deal with “Secrecy of Certain Inventions and Filing Patent Applications in Foreign Countries”. These sections of the U. S. Patent Law have the purpose of preventing publication of information which may be detrimental to national security. Thus, the legislative intent of 35 USC 112, to require a full disclosure, should be reconciled with the legislative intent of 35 USC 181, et seq., to prevent public disclosure of information which may be detrimental to national security.\r\n\r\nFor example, a development may be made having both a military application and a commercial application. The preferred embodiment of the invention (the best mode) contemplated by the inventor may be the military application whose publication would be barred under the above national security provisions of 35 USC 181, et seq. Therefore if that best mode is indeed described in the specification as required under \r\n35 USC 112, a “Secrecy Order” would be applied under 35 USC 181, et seq. barring publication of the invention. Such “a Secrecy Order” would thus prevent the applicant from exploiting the invention, would deprive the public of the information regarding the invention, and would subject the Government to a claim for reasonable compensation (35 USC 183).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if publication of the commercial, inferior embodiment would not be detrimental to national security, it would appear preferable, and consistent with the “legislative intent” with respect to the above two conflicting statutory provisions, to permit the inventor to describe the inferior (commercial) embodiment, rather than the preferred (military) embodiment. Such a legislative intent would benefit both the public and the inventor and would thus best implement the Constitutional basis for the patent laws (Article 1, Sec. 8):\r\n\r\n“-- to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”.\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be consistent with the approach already taken by the courts in an analogous situation, illustrated by the “fun example” described in the Walmsley article. In this example, an inventor discovered that acid deposits from terminal posts of a car battery could be removed by using a carbonated soft drink, and that best results were obtained when using “Coca-Cola” (Registered Trade Mark of the Coca-Cola Company). Since the composition of a product identified by a trade mark may be kept secret (as indeed it is in this case), and may be changed at will by the manufacturer, the best mode disclosure requirement of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, if interpreted strictly and absolutely, would require a disclosure of the actual composition of “Coca-Cola”. However, as pointed out in the Walmsley article, it has been held that the disclosure of the trade name but not the formula, of a cleaning solution used in the claimed invention was sufficient for best mode purposes (see Randomex, Inc. v Scopus Corp., 849 f.2d 585 (Fed Cir. 1988)).\r\n\r\nSummarizing the foregoing, it is believed that the legislative intent in \r\n35 USC 112, first paragraph, was:\r\n\r\n(a)    to apply primarily a quantitative test to the "enabling requirement", i.e., to require sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention;\r\n\r\n(b)    to apply primarily a qualitative test to the "best mode" requirement, i.e., to require that the information supplied in the specification be directed, or at least include, the "best mode" contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention;\r\n\r\n(c)     to apply a claims standard in determining the scope of the subject matter to be disclosed, i.e., to measure the information required to be supplied in the specification by the scope of the invention as defined in the claims; and\r\n\r\n(d)     to apply a public policy test to the “best mode” requirement, i.e., to permit an inferior mode to serve as the best mode where the actual best mode may not be legally permissible or practically possible, e.g., because of national security considerations, trade secret considerations, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be emphasized that the above tests apply only to the “best mode requirement” of 35 USC 112, first paragraph, and not to the “enabling requirement”. The “enabling requirement”, it is believed, was intended to be an independent requirement, separate and distinct from the “best mode” requirement, in determining compliance or non-compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nProposed Four-Prong Approach\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing analysis, a four-prong approach, believed to be realistic, objective and consistent with the legislative intent, is proposed below to test the specification disclosure with compliance with 35 USC 112, first paragraph:\r\n\r\n1. Determine whether the specification contains sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement (primarily a quantitative test).\r\n\r\n2. If so, determine whether the disclosed information relates to the “best mode” implementation of the invention, or is it restricted to an inferior mode (primarily a qualitative test). If it does not relate to or include the "best mode", then presumably there was an intent to conceal the best mode and to lead the public to an inferior mode, and therefore the best mode requirement is presumably violated.\r\n\r\n3. In testing both the enabling requirement and the best mode requirement, consider that the scope of the subject matter required to be disclosed is that relating to the invention as defined in the claims. For example, if the claims recite a fuel feeding system including valves, controls, actuators, etc., and no novelty is claimed in the construction of the valves, controls, or actuators, it presumably would not be essential to disclose the details of such valves, controls, or actuators to meet the best mode requirement, assuming of course that the enabling requirement is met.\r\n\r\n4. If the disclosed embodiment does not include or relate to the best mode, determine whether there is a legal justification, based on public policy, for not including a description of the best mode. As indicated above, one possible legal justification would be where the best mode involves a national security embodiment which may not be publicly disclosed and which, if described in the patent application, would subject the application to a Secrecy Order. As discussed above, public policy should justify permitting the disclosure of the best non-security implementation even though it was not the actual best mode. Another possible justification is illustrated by the “Coca Cola” example mentioned above, wherein the courts have already held that, in certain cases, failure to disclose a secret formulation identified by a trademark does not necessarily violate 35 USC 112, first paragraph.\r\n\r\nBy thus applying, per prongs 1 and 2 above, a primarily quantitative test to the enabling requirement, and a primarily qualitative test to the best mode requirement, Section 35 USC 112, first paragraph, would require: (1) that the description provide sufficient information to meet the enabling requirement, and (2) that the such supplied information relate to the best mode requirement. In other words, this provision would require that the specification include a description of the best mode, and that such a description be sufficient to meet the enabling requirement, but need not include all the know-how, trade-secret, etc., information known to the inventor for "optimizing" the best mode.\r\n\r\nBy applying, per prong 3 above, a “claims standard” to the scope of the subject matter required to be included in the description, numerous technical details not related to the claimed novelty would not be required to be included in the description, thereby relieving the inventor from the burden, and possible commercial implications, of disclosing technical details not directly related to the invention. \r\nBy applying, per prong 4 above, a “public policy” test permitting a “second best” mode in certain cases (e.g., because of a possible detriment to the national security), the constitutional purpose of the patent system, in promoting the progress of science and the useful arts, is best implemented, by making available to the public a description of the invention without compromising national security, while at the same time securing for limited times to the inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries.\r\n\r\nReplacing the present unrealistic, subjective tests for the best mode requirement as applied in recent decisions, by the above four-prong, realistic objective test, will provide a clear and stable definition of this requirement consistent with the apparent legislative intent. As a consequence, it will avoid, to a large extent, the many disadvantages in over-complying with this requirement, the risks in under-complying with this requirement, and last, but not least, the need to make the exhaustive “sniff and probe” type examination involved in the anecdote at the beginning of this article.\r\n\r\nBenjamin J.

E2020, marketed as Aricept®, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range.\r\n\r\nResults: Our experimental structure of the E2020–TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the ‘oxyanion hole’, but only indirectly via solvent molecules.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link:\r\n<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&amp;searchtype=a">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VSR-3WM4NN5-B&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F15%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e6456f67dbb2b8029d94c2418f6e8f81&amp;searchtype=a</a>', 'Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 ( Aricept ® ):', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '263-revision-5', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:08', '2013-07-08 08:02:08', '', 263, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=460', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Unlike ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of ErbB-3 is catalytically impaired. By using interleukin-3-dependent cells that ectopically express the three ErbB proteins or their combinations, we found that ErbB-3 is devoid of any biological activity but both ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 can reconstitute its extremely potent mitogenic activity. Transactivation of ErbB-3 correlates with heterodimer formation and is reflected in receptor phosphorylation and the transregulation of ligand affinity. Inter-receptor interactions enable graded proliferative and survival signals: heterodimers are more potent than homodimers, and ErbB-3-containing complexes, especially the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer, are more active than ErbB-1 complexes. Nevertheless, ErbB-1 signaling displays dominance over ErbB-3 when the two receptors are coexpressed. Although all receptor combinations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and c-Jun kinase, they differ in their rate of endocytosis and in coupling to intervening signaling proteins. It is conceivable that combinatorial receptor interactions diversify signal transduction and confer double regulation, in cis and in trans, of the superior mitogenic activity of the kinase-defective ErbB-3.\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC450177/pdf/emboj00010-0132.pdf</a>', 'Diversification of Neu differentiation factor and epidermal growth factor signaling by combinatorial receptor interactions.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '260-revision-4', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:35', '2013-07-08 08:02:35', '', 260, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=461', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Whereas ErbB-1 binds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF), both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to the Neu differentiation factors (NDFs, or neuregulins), and ErbB-2, the most oncogenic family member, is an orphan receptor whose function is still unknown. Because previous lines of evidence indicated the existence of interreceptor interactions, we used ectopic expression of individual ErbB proteins and their combinations to analyze the details of receptor cross talks. We show that 8 of 10 possible homo-and heterodimeric complexes of ErbB proteins can be hierarchically induced by ligand binding. Although ErbB-2 binds neither ligand, even in a heterodimeric receptor complex, it is the preferred heterodimer partner of the three other members, and it favors interaction with ErbB-3. Selective receptor overexpression in human tumor cells appears to bias the hierarchical relationships. The ordered network is reflected in receptor transphosphorylation, ErbB-2-mediated enhancement of ligand affinities, and remarkable potentiation of mitogenesis by a coexpressed ErbB-2. The observed superior ability of ErbB-2 to form heterodimers, in conjunction with its uniquely high basal tyrosine kinase activity, may explain why ErbB-2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC231527/pdf/165276.pdf</a>', 'A hierarchical network of interreceptor interactions determines signal transduction by Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin and epidermal growth factor.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '258-revision-16', '', '', '2013-07-08 08:02:54', '2013-07-08 08:02:54', '', 258, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=462', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, some ligands are more potent than others, although they bind to the same direct receptor. In addition, signaling by receptor heterodimers is superior to homodimers. We addressed the mechanism underlying these two features of signal tuning by using three ligands: EGF; transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha); and their chimera, denoted E4T, which act on cells singly expressing ErbB-1 as a weak, a strong, and a very strong agonist, respectively. Co-expression of ErbB-2, a developmentally important co-receptor whose expression is frequently elevated in human cancers, specifically potentiated EGF signaling to the level achieved by TGFalpha, an effect that was partially mimicked by ErbB-3. Analysis of the mechanism underlying this trans-potentiation implied that EGF-driven homodimers of ErbB-1 are destined for intracellular degradation, whereas the corresponding heterodimers with ErbB-2 or with ErbB-3, dissociate in the early endosome. As a consequence, in the presence of either co-receptor, ErbB-1 is recycled to the cell surface and its signaling is enhanced. This latter route is followed by TGFalpha-driven homodimers of ErbB-1, and also by E4T-bound receptors, whose signaling is further enhanced by repeated cycles of binding and dissociation from the receptors. We conclude that alternative endocytic routes of homo- and hetero-dimeric receptor complexes may contribute to tuning and diversification of signal transduction. In addition, the ability of ErbB-2 to shunt ligand-activated receptors to recycling may explain, in part, its oncogenic\r\n\r\nTo view the full text please follow the link: \r\n<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170676/pdf/003385.pdf</a>\r\n', 'Differential endocytic routing of homo- and hetero-dimeric ErbB tyrosine kinases confers signaling superiority to receptor heterodimers.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '256-revision-5', '', '', '2013-07-07 13:39:02', '2013-07-07 13:39:02', '', 256, 'http://ipatent.co.il/?p=463', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
